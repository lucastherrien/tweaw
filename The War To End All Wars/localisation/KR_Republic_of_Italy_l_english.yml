### Events ###

ita.1.t:0 "The Republic of Italy in 1936"
ita.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the fall of Rome in 1919, an exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Austrians, seemingly destined to be divided again into her old pre-unification states. Mere hours after the humiliating announcement of capitulation, enraged nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Milan, and that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. However, not so far away in Torino, a competing Socialist Republic was proclaimed just days later. Austria's plans for dividing Italy were quickly torn to pieces.\n\nAs civil war erupted and the fighting dragged on, the Austrians and their garrisons came to fight alongside the new nationalist Republic, finding a common enemy in the Socialists and their French supporters. Despite a miraculous victory at the Po, the erstwhile enemies found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. Austria would recognise the Republic of Italy as the only legitimate government, while the nationalists had to accept working with the Austrians and the unwelcome influence this came with.\n\nDespite initial concerns, this alliance slowly improved the economic standing of the new Republic, which drew strength from Austria and the German Reichspakt, and as she recovered from the civil war many began to look to the future. Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi and his coalition, buoyed by economic success, still claim the rest of Italy as de-jure parts of the Italian Nation, and it is only a matter of time before another Italian War breaks out."
ita.1.a:0 "Forward Italia!"

ita.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Republic"
ita.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that started in Germany has spiralled out of control and has spread to Italy. The Republic of Italy's prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and the confidence in the government has been shaken."
ita.2.a:0 "May God Protect us!"

ita.3.t:0 "Ivanoe Bonomi calls for a General Election"
ita.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting the Republic of Italy, Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi has decided to call for a general election. Elections will be held in 1936 instead of 1939 as it was scheduled. Hopefully, with this election, the Prime Minister will be able to shore up support for his policies to resolve the economic crisis."
ita.3.a:0 "Let us hope this will solve things"

ita.4.t:0 "D'Annunzio and Balbo's Speech"
ita.4.d:0 "Italo Balbo and Gabriele D'Annunzio of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana(Italian Nationalist Association) delivered a speech in the city of Verona today. During the speech, they blamed the government of the republic for causing the economic crisis. Moreover, they went on to describe Austria's role in keeping Italy divided and weak, and that the syndicalists were only allowed to continue to exist as a foil to the Republic. D'Annunzio and Balbo promise that it is only the ANI that is able to restore Italy to glory and destroy all her enemies."
ita.4.a:0 "We best keep an eye on them"

ita.5.t:0 "The Church comments on the crisis"
ita.5.d:0 "A number of influential figures within the church have been rallying support for political figures during their sermons. Of particular note are the Archbishops of Milan and Venice, who have urged parishioners to follow traditional catholic values during this crisis, a none too subtle nod of support for the conservative Popolare Italiano party. However some bishops, though not as influential as those in Milan and Venice, have instead urged support for Catholic Social Teaching and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. In both cases, people are listening to the advice of the church."

ita.6.t:0 "Rosselli supports Bonomi"

ita.6.a:0 "Thank you, Rosselli"

ita.7.t:0 "Protests against farm auctions"
ita.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages, and their livestock and property are normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Italian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Italian People's Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the government's position on the issue?"
ita.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue"
ita.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions"

ita.8.t:0 "Influence in the Italian election?"
ita.8.d:0 "The Italian Republic is in the midst of a general election and we have considerable influence there. We can give our support and backing to one of the political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. However, some ministers are concerned that the overt involvement this would require might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association.

This notion has already been denounced by right-wing members of parliament as 'siding with syndicalism', and suggest they should be de-collectivized and privatized. Those in the centre believe that the economy should be de-syndicalized, but slowly, as to not arouse the anger of the syndicalists."

It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman Italo Balbo believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions. This would allow more men to actually fly."

ita.80.d:0 "While the various other Italian nationalities, most notably the Venetians, were always making noise, they were held in check by the fact Italy wasn't united and our attention was on bigger issues. However, now that Italy is re-unified, we need to address this matter once and for all. We can force the various Italians to accept that there is only one Italy and one Italian language. However this plan, while popular, has the potential to stir up trouble that we would rather not deal with.
