JAP_narrow_rail:0 "Kyoki Railways"
JAP_narrow_rail_desc:0 "Japan's railways were built using an unusually narrow gauge inherited from the British Empire during the Meiji Era. While it does make construction easier in Japan's mountainous terrain, its speed limitations have negatively impacted our industry. Experts argue over whether conversion is worth the government's time."

Military_Training_Curriculum_desc:0 "Military training was firstly introduced into the compulsory physical education curriculum in 1925 by the Tanaka regime, as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence and discontent among students, and was discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926. It is time to reverse that decision."
National_Service_Draft_Ordinance_1:0 "The National Service Draft Ordinance"
National_Service_Draft_Ordinance_1_desc:0 "The National Service Draft Ordinance is a supplement to the earlier National Total Mobilisation Ordinance, particularly its Article 4, which had enabled the Government to mobilise the labour force.

JAP_bad_land:0 "Poor Land Use"

JAP_land_reform_desc:0 "Land reform has been an ongoing issue in Japanese politics for nearly 70 years. We are not the first to attempt to resolve the issue and, if we are not careful, will not be the last. The more effort and time we put in, the more likely it is our efforts will bear fruit, though we are free to declare an end to our programme at any time..."

### Focuses - Political - Base ###
JAP_NSA_focus:0 "The National Security Act"
JAP_NSA_focus_desc:0 "A debate in the Diet regarding the national security act has been raging for the past few weeks, and it is time for us to decide which course our nation will take. Some conservative members of the Diet fear that if the act isn't passed, radical elements in society will try to seize power. The future of Japan is in our hands."
JAP_democratic_path:0 "Defend Democracy!"
JAP_democratic_path_desc:0 "After receiving the offer from the scheming army officers, General Hayashi Senjuro has rejected to back their coup attempt, citing his responsibility to the established regime. While not actively opposing the putschists, it is unlikely they can win without the support of the central command."
JAP_imperialist_path:0 "The Longest Day"

JAP_fem_reform:0 "Enact Women's Suffrage"
JAP_fem_reform_desc:0 "While feminist activity started in Japan back in the 19th century they have only recently managed to achieve any progress by overthrowing the 'Police Security Act' in 1921.

JAP_chuou_start:0 "A Political Blueprint"

JAP_chuou_fund_desc:0 "The Fund Adjustment Ordinance is the first of a series of 'National Defence Ordinances' decrees by the Centralist regime. The state-owned Bank of Japan is now empowered to regulate capital investments, establishment of companies, and the subscription or underwriting of securities. This will allow the Government to control and allocate funds to war industries."
JAP_chuou_mob:0 "National Total Mobilisation Ordinance"
JAP_chuou_mob_desc:0 "The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance is designed to provide the Government a means to control and mobilise all the resources and manpower available in the Empire.

JAP_ishinha:0 "The Showa Restoration"
JAP_ishinha_desc:0 "After being left out of key governmental and administrative position in the new Japanese government, the Restoration faction of the army is disgruntled and is planning another coup. If they are to gain the support of the Emperor, they are likely to succeed."
JAP_yokuseiha:0 "Yokuseiha Faction"
JAP_yokuseiha_desc:0 "The Yokuseiha faction is comprised of ex-parliament members with restorationist tendencies. They resist the dictatorial plans set by Konoe for the Taisei Yokusankai and prefer a decentralised approach to restoration."
JAP_yokuseiha_POL:0 "Separation of Powers"
JAP_yokuseiha_POL_desc:0 "While supporting imperial restoration the Yokuseiha members also see the problem with absolute power. Partly to prevent corruption and partly to secure their power they arrange a decentralised system for the Taisei Yokusankai."
JAP_yokuseiha_ECO:0 "A Free Market"
JAP_yokuseiha_ECO_desc:0 "Keeping in line with their decentralised approach the Yokuseiha propose an economic plan consisting of minimal state intervention in the economy. While this would allow groups like the Zaibatsu to gain more power this policy will also endear the regime to them."
JAP_yokuseiha_AGR:0 "Colonial Investments"
JAP_yokuseiha_AGR_desc:0 "In response to the agricultural crisis Japan faces the Yokuseiha faction proposes a programme of settlement incentives in Japanese mainland colonies in China and elsewhere.

JAP_kodoha_POL_desc:0 "The Kodoha faction resists Konoe's efforts in creating a separate dictatorial power from the imperial court and instead wish to transfer ultimate power to the emperor in a form of absolutism where the Taisei Yokusankai is a subject of the emperor."
JAP_kodoha_ECO:0 "Nationalisation"

JAP_kodoha_AGR:0 "Land Reform"
JAP_kodoha_AGR_desc:0 "The revolutionary part of the Kodoha faction shows itself in their radical plan of land redistribution. The Kodoha leadership believes drawing a plan for national land reform will solve both the agricultural crisis and the rise of syndicalism."
JAP_kakushinha:0 "Kakushinha Faction"
JAP_kakushinha_desc:0 "The Kakushinha, or reform faction, is led by prince Konoe and is mainly comprised of intellectuals and politicians and aims for a reconstruction of the Japanese political system with an absolute Taisei Yokusankai at the core of Japanese society."
JAP_kakushinha_POL:0 "A New System"
JAP_kakushinha_POL_desc:0 "The political plan of the Kakushinha faction was to create a single centralised political body which will combine the executive, legislative and administrative powers of the Japanese empire.

### Focuses - Economic - Zaibatsu ###
JAP_ZAI_ECO:0 "Support the Zaibatsu"
JAP_ZAI_ECO_desc:0 "Over the past several decades the Zaibatsu have increased their political and economic power to a staggering degree. It would be in our best interest to cooperate with them."
JAP_ZAI_FAC:0 "Zaibatsu Factory Construction"
JAP_ZAI_FAC_desc:0 "Some Zaibatsu have requested state help to build factories throughout the home islands. This would create many jobs and help resolve the economic crisis."

JAP_NAT_ZAI:0 "Nationalise The Zaibatsu"
JAP_NAT_ZAI_desc:0 "Since the Meiji Restoration and subsequent westernisation the Zaibatsu had been the heart of economic and industrial activity within Japan. They hold great influence over domestic and foreign policy. The Imperial Army has always opposed the Zaibatsu's influence and worked for their liquidation. Now that they effectively control the country the Army can nationalise all major Zaibatsu and destroy their influence."
JAP_NAT_AIR:0 "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
JAP_NAT_AIR_desc:0 "The aircraft industry is a vital part of national defence and is thus too important to be left in private hands. All military aircraft manufacturers must be nationalised and reformed into arsenals or merged into military controlled factories."
JAP_NAT_IND:0 "Nationalise Heavy Industry"
JAP_NAT_IND_desc:0 "After the break up and nationalisation of the Zaibatsu we control most of the heavy industry in the country, but not all. Some companies are below Zaibatsu level in prominence but are still major firms. To achieve total state control, it will be necessary to nationalise them."

JAP_BUR_CAR_1:0 "Integration of Foreign Motor Companies"
JAP_BUR_CAR_1_desc:0 "The Japanese auto market has always been dominated by American car makers causing a deep trade deficit. When the Second American Civil War broke out many American companies and knock-down plants in Japan lost contact with their parent companies and have been struggling to get parts for their assembly lines. MITI bureaucrats see this as a prime opportunity to assimilate these factories."
JAP_BUR_CAR_2:0 "Regulating the Automotive Industry"
JAP_BUR_CAR_2_desc:0 "Throughout the 1920's and 1930's Japanese domestic automotive production was too small to compete globally. To remedy this and enable domestic firms to compete with much bigger Western counterparts we can force a merger of our many small automotive firms into a few big businesses."
JAP_BUR_OIL:0 "Reorganisation of The Oil Industry"
JAP_BUR_OIL_desc:0 "With the country at war the oil industry has been subjected to greater bureaucratic supervision and forced to undergo a structural reorganisation under the MITI's guidance.

JAP_COL_TAIWAN:0 "Increase Emigration To Taiwan"
JAP_COL_TAIWAN_desc:0 "Taiwan, the richest and most prosperous colony in the Empire, promises limitless bounty to those that settle there. The government must begin to provide incentives for emigration, providing the means for farmers from depressed areas to travel."
JAP_COL_PORT:0 "Increase Emigration to Kwantung"
JAP_COL_PORT_desc:0 "Although the Kwantung Leased Territory was only officially granted to Japan for a period of 99 years, the city of Dairen and its surrounds make an excellent destination for Japanese settlers.

### Events ###
japdom.1.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
japdom.1.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
japdom.1.a:0 "Gaman shiyou."

japdom.2.t:0 "Dissolution of the Diet"
japdom.2.d:0 "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called a general election for February 20th."
japdom.2.a:0 "Very well."

japdom.3.t:0 "General Election 1936"
japdom.3.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
japdom.3.a:0 "The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!"
japdom.3.b:0 "The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!"

japdom.4.t:0 "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
japdom.4.d:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements. Yesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
japdom.4.a:0 "This will be bad..."

japdom.5.t:0 "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
japdom.5.d:0 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party at expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) but also outside the party, notably within the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."
japdom.5.a:0 "An interesting development."

japdom.6.t:0 "The May 15 Incident"
japdom.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirokei broke into the official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did it to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy."
japdom.6.a:0 "Appoint Suzuki Kisaburo to replace Inukai"

japdom.7.t:0 "Restorationists and Centralists"
japdom.7.d:0 "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chuuha', the central faction, who were close to the central military leadership who supported cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."
japdom.7.a:0 "Will this ever end?"

japdom.8.t:0 "Disagreements within Army Leadership"
japdom.8.d:0 "The ongoing factional rivalry within the ranks of the IJA has found a new front: the military strategic debate between the two rising stars, Major General Nagata Tetsuzan (of the Centralist Faction) and Major General Obata Toshishiro (of the Restorationist Faction).\n\nGeneral Nagata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and thus building up a total war capable army should be our top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower. We may now choose how to proceed."
japdom.8.a:0 "I will choose wisely."

japdom.9.t:0 "The National Security Act"
japdom.9.d:0 "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kanto anarchist uprising in September 1923 and a syndicalist's assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
japdom.9.a:0 "The Act is forced through."
japdom.9.b:0 "Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act."

japdom.10.t:0 "The Trial of the May 15 Incident"
japdom.10.d:0 "The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
japdom.10.a:0 "This country is going crazy..."

japdom.11.t:0 "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.11.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichiro were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal."
japdom.11.a:0 "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

japdom.12.t:0 "Government under Fire"
japdom.12.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's incapability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."
japdom.12.a:0 "Suzuki's days are numbered..."

japdom.13.t:0 "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.13.d:0 "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet, and with lukewarm support former Home Minister Mizuno Rentaro was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."
japdom.13.a:0 "Call emergency convention!"

japdom.14.t:0 "The Election of Mizuno Rentaro"
japdom.14.dead:0 "The death of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyukai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejiro (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyu Honto during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though has stopped short of crowning himself chairman and instead elected current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentaro instead."

japdom.15.t:0 "Japan's Longest Winter"
japdom.15.d:0 "The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralysed. The downfall of two successive Seiyukai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only worsened the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is getting more and more frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'rescue' the Empire. The plotters have approached Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro for his support..."

japdom.16.t:0 "Japan's Longest Day"
japdom.16.d:0 "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'état. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
japdom.16.a:0 "Banzai!"

japdom.17.t:0 "Failed Coup Attempt"
japdom.17.d:0 "Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested. One of them, General Terauchi Hisaichi, committed suicide by seppuku today."
japdom.17.a:0 "Democracy has prevailed!"

japdom.18.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
japdom.18.d:0 "Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution, however under the successive government the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun."
japdom.18.a:0 "Will this ever end?"

japdom.19.t:0 "The Ishinha Counter-Coup"
japdom.19.d:0 "Earlier today Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon the emperor himself addressed the soldiers announcing his official support of their revolution."

japdom.23.d:0 "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kodo Kokubo Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."

The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."

japdom.25.t:0 "The New System Movement"
japdom.25.d:0 "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undo) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimaro, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
japdom.25.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward"

japdom.26.t:0 "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
japdom.26.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level a direct link between politics and the people will be established, and by having every important interest group represented at its core it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policy. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society. Three main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association). The latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."

One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council. Last month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai."

japdom.51.d:0 "The Tokko, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokko is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death.

In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."

japdom.54.t:0 "1940 General Election"

japdom.61.d_pervasive:0 "After studying the nature of the ongoing drought, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, and Home Affairs, have concluded that there is little more that can be done to stem the impact of the drought beyond the measures that have already been taken. However, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has come forward with a proposition in which Fengtian could be coerced into exporting millet and rice to Korea, with Korea then providing its own rice to feed Japan. Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, our political and economic stranglehold over the country should be enough to prevent any dissent."

Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, surely the Fengtian Government should be willing to assist their benefactor in its time of need."
japdom.61.a:0 "They will have no choice."
japdom.61.b:0 "Send the request."
japdom.61.c:0 "We will endure."

japdom.62.t:0 "Fengtian Refuses our Proposal"
japdom.62.d:0 "In an act of unprecedented impertinence, the Fengtian Government has refused our proposal to ameliorate the impact of the drought. Surely this act of gross and unacceptable disrespect will be met with sound retribution!"

### Zankoas's new events japdom.65 onwards ###

japdom.65.t:0 "The Emperor and Democracy"
japdom.65.d:0 "The government is weak, so in a desperate move, have asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance and fortunately has supported the government. His words carry great weight, and may be enough to keep the government afloat. Do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
japdom.65.a:0 "Lets us agree with the Emperor."
japdom.65.b:0 "He is out of line!"

japdom.72.t:0 "The Emperor and Democracy"
japdom.72.d:0 "The government is weak, so in a desperate move, have asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance but he has refused to support the government. His words carry great weight, and this lack of support may be a fatal blow. Without intervention the government will surely fall, do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
japdom.72.a:0 "Lets us agree with the Emperor."
japdom.72.b:0 "He is out of line!"

japdom.66.t:0 "Political Resistance"
japdom.66.d:0 "Though people say they are willing to lay down their life for the emperor, putting that to the test has been less successful than we would have liked. There has been political resistance to our mass mobilisation campaign, and while it is pushing ahead as planned, it has weakened out political position."
japdom.66.a:0 "I see."

japdom.67.t:0 "Decreasing Quality"
japdom.67.d:0 "Our third phase of mobilisation is underway, but already we have discovering that these new recruits aren't up to standard, but it is to late to turn back, all we can do is hope combat trains them well."
japdom.67.a:0 "I understand."

japdom.68.t:0 "Command Disagreements"
japdom.68.d:0 "Nagata and Obata have had an argument. Each has called the other a fool, and now they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army are without leadership."
japdom.68.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.69.t:0 "Another Disagreement"
japdom.69.d:0 "Nagata and Obata have had another argument. They nearly came to blows with one another, and now, once again, they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army are without leadership. We must be careful with the political situation to avoid things like this."
japdom.69.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.70.t:0 "Yet More Fighting"
japdom.70.d:0 "Nagata and Obata have had yet another argument. This time they declared each other to be the greatest threat Japan has ever faced, and once more they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army are without leadership. Fortunately, those close to them say they have nearly reaching a compromise, so hopefully this will be the last argument they have."
japdom.70.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.74.t:0 "Switching Rail Gauge"

japdom.74.a:0 "Hurrah!"

japdom.75.t:0 "Land Reform Complete"
japdom.75.bad:0 "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, sadly we will not be the last either. Our efforts have been a waste of time, nothing less than a complete Disaster! We have been unable to even make a dent in the issue; it will surely plague our economy for years to come..."
japdom.75.okay:0 "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions but we may be the last, while we haven't revolutionised land use, we have fixed many issues, enough that inefficient land use will no longer plague our economy."
japdom.75.good:0 "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have succeeded! We have not only fixed many of the underlying issues but gone above and beyond; we have purchased and redistributed tens of thousands of hectares of land to landless or tenant farmers and are already beginning to see the benefits of our work!"
japdom.75.great:0 "It's a miracle! Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have done what many thought was impossible! We have completed what is being internationally recognised as one of the largest land redistribution programs in history. 2.3 million hectares of land have been distributed to farmers during the project and landlordism as Japan knew it no longer exists."
japdom.75.a:0 "How could this have happened..."
japdom.75.b:0 "I'll take it!"
japdom.75.c:0 "Banzai!"
japdom.75.d:0 "Banzai Banzai Banzai!"
