### Focuses ###
LEC_shanghai:0 "Struggle for Shanghai"
LEC_shanghai_desc:0 "The Legation Cities have always been lawless, but the recent downturn in the global economy has somehow made matters worse. Smuggling into AllgOstAsien territory has increased and the Legation Council has been unable to pay its civil servants for several months now. We have always needed to work with the secret criminal fraternities, true, but now it seems they are taking on more de-facto power than our government..."
LEC_man1:0 "The Mandate Prevails"
LEC_man1_desc:0 "We have managed to endure the past few traumatic months and emerge battered, but still in power. We must endeavour to solidify our position at once."
LEC_man2:0 "Solidify our Position"
LEC_man2_desc:0 "We must take steps to solidify our rule and imprisoning known Blue Lanterns and 49er's will be a good start."

LEC_man8:0 "Reinforce our Economy"
LEC_man8_desc:0 "With our nation cleansed of the taint of corruption and malaise we can finally focus our efforts on ridding ourselves of this economic hardship"
LEC_man9:0 "Economic Boom"
LEC_man9_desc:0 "With our new economic reforms in place we are making and trading more than we ever did before Black Monday!"
LEC_comm1:0 "The Commissioner Takes Control"
LEC_comm1_desc:0 "After an emergency session of the Legation Council it has been decided that during this unprecedented crisis our Legation Mandate is suspended and the Commissioner will rule as the de-jure representative of the entire Council."
LEC_comm2:0 "Executive Orders Act"
LEC_comm2_desc:0 "Now that we have taken control of the Legation Council we must cement our power base. Being able to rule by executive order will allow us access to all the powers needed to crush the Triads and dissidents in the Cities."
LEC_comm3:0 "Public Gatherings Outlawed"
LEC_comm3_desc:0 "Public gatherings are breeding grounds for Triad activities and dissident subversion. If we do not outlaw them resistance to our rule will harden."
LEC_comm4:0 "Incorporation of the Firms"
LEC_comm4_desc:0 "It has been decided that pull ourselves out of this serious economic slump we should nationalise all private firms and put them under our stewardship. Of course this will only be for the duration of the current crisis..."
LEC_comm5:0 "Dissolve the Legation Council"
LEC_comm5_desc:0 "The mandatory countries have agreed that further powers must be granted to the sole leader of the Legation Council, meaning the effective dissolution the Council until the crisis facing the Cities is over."
LEC_comm6:0 "Autocratic Rule"
LEC_comm6_desc:0 "Think how much we can accomplish if we don't have to worry about petty frivolities such as human rights and democracy. We can bring great boons to all citizens if they fall into line."
LEC_comm7:0 "Reforging the Economy"
LEC_comm7_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grip on power we can finally rid our country of perverted dissident influences and the economic malaise that has warped our cities. A new economic model will inevitably bring us back to prosperity."
LEC_triad1:0 "Night of the Monkey's Head"
LEC_triad1_desc:0 "Big Ears Du has taken advantage of the economic difficulties in Shanghai and the other Legation Ports to become undisputed master of the extensive criminal networks criss-crossing the autonomous cities. Despite this, total political control has thus far escaped him. He consults his soothsayer to see what the omens have in store for him..."
LEC_triad2:0 "The Syndicates Split"
LEC_triad2_desc:0 "After the stunning massacres of the Night of the Monkey's Head. The Triads are now in de-facto sole control of the Legation Cities and now must decide between them who should be the Dragon Head."
LEC_triad3:0 "Reinvest our Profits"
LEC_triad3_desc:0 "We have now made more than enough capital from our illicit ventures to rid the cities of irritating corruption (that is unconnected to us) and encourage foreign capital to return under our "protection"."
LEC_qing1:0 "Jiang Qing"
LEC_qing1_desc:0 "Jiang Qing might not seem a likely Dragon Head at only 22 years of age but she has had a meteoric rise within the United Triads. Her dominance over mass-scale opium production and collaboration with foreign growers and markets gives us a bizarrely viable method by which to strengthen the weakened economy, a weakness we both created and inherited..."
LEC_qing2:0 "Focus on Opium"
LEC_qing2_desc:0 "With the rule of Jiang Qing cemented she now turns her attention to implementing her Opium-based agenda. Triad liquidity has been plowed into Opium farms and improving supply chains in order to boost local production."
LEC_qing3:0 "Afghan Opium"
LEC_qing3_desc:0 "In the past our Opium has directly competed with Afghan product. Jiang Qing has decided that by co-operating with these growers we can increase our supply while bringing more profit to the Afghan growers - making it an obvious win-win for all involved."
LEC_qing4:0 "Bengali Opium"
LEC_qing4_desc:0 "After our profitable partnership with the Afghan growers we should now seek to expand to the lucrative Bengali Market. with the Syndicalist regime overshadowing growers they face a lack of foreign capital and heavy risks to both production and sale. If we step to support them we can incorporate another rival and increase our market share."
LEC_tu1:0 "Tu Yueh Sen"
LEC_tu1_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly 'Big Ears Du' is widely seen as the safest and most likely choice for Dragon Head. After all it is thanks to his efforts that the Triads now dominate the cities virtually unopposed. He promises a traditional platform of arms smuggling, counterfeiting and racketeering to bring the economy some sense of order."
LEC_tu2:0 "Increase the Arms Trade"
LEC_tu2_desc:0 "With the upsurge in armed conflicts across the globe we must increase the amount and quality of arms that we smuggle and sell to the various war-torn nations. The more bloodshed, the more we profit. After all if they did not buy it from us, they would just go elsewhere!"
LEC_tu3:0 "Protection Rackets"
LEC_tu3_desc:0 "The Cities are a violent and dangerous place as we well know. We should make sure that all businesses are aware of our new "protection" policies and that they sign up to them immediately. It isn't tribute, it is protection money."
LEC_tu4:0 "Cigarette Counterfeiting"
LEC_tu4_desc:0 "It's important that we maintain if not increase smuggling of Golden Dragon cigarettes into the AOG and Qing territories. We must continue to do so even if we do not actually have the stocks needed to maintain such supply. Who would know if a few cutbacks are made..."
LEC_jinrong1:0 "Huang Jinrong"
LEC_jinrong1_desc:0 "Huang Jinrong has been a fixture of Hong Kong for many years with many ties to legitimate and illegitimate ventures. He advocates a focus on exploiting the vices that we provide and sponsor and to take a greater share of the profits from them."
LEC_jinrong2:0 "Strengthen our Smugglers"
LEC_jinrong2_desc:0 "For too long we have left our smugglers with only the minimum support that we could provide under the Mandate Authorities. Now that we are in charge of the Cities we can fully sponsor their efforts."
LEC_jinrong3:0 "Passport Counterfeiting"
LEC_jinrong3_desc:0 "Passports are a valuable commodity and now that we have seized the Cities we now have access to the presses left behind by the Mandate Nations. We can use these to create new passports both for our smugglers and any other interested buyers."
LEC_jinrong4:0 "Human Trafficking"
LEC_jinrong4_desc:0 "Our citizens are finding our use of local women distasteful while our clientele is now requesting a more exotic menagerie to choose from. We should seek to bring in outside sources to diversify our talent pool."
LEC_def1:0 "The Legation Defence Force"
LEC_def1_desc:0 "We are at a crossroads when it comes to our defence. Chinese citizens do not want to sign up and a large part of our population is made up of disunified foreigners from various different nations. We must act to try remedy this manpower crisis."
LEC_defp1:0 "Expand the Police Force"
LEC_defp1_desc:0 "We have decided to expand our current standing police force. Cash incentives and social benefits will now be offered to all willing recruits, and we will now also accept women into the force."
LEC_defp2:0 "Increase Patrols"
LEC_defp2_desc:0 "We must increase the presence of our Police Force within the cities. Without a powerful display of our disciplined force the Blue Lanterns and dissidents will think they are free to do what they like. This is certainly not the case."
LEC_defp3:0 "Militarise the Force"
LEC_defp3_desc:0 "The menace posed to our stability by outside threats and internal vermin is too great to ignore. We must start to organise and militarise our police force to create de facto army units straight away."
LEC_deft1:0 "Incorporate the 49er's"
LEC_deft1_desc:0 "With our rule of the Cities now firmly in place we must seek to build a new defence force outside of the limited police detachments. As a start we should incorporate the 49er's as the basis for these military units."
LEC_deft2:0 "Initiate the Blue Lanterns"
LEC_deft2_desc:0 "Now that we have a core to build our forces off we need more able recruits. We should seek to immediately initiate all Blue Lanterns within the cities. If they break their oath then we will have to punish then."
LEC_deft3:0 "Delegate to the Red Pole"
LEC_deft3_desc:0 "Now that we have a well-staffed and maintained defence force we should seek to delegate the commands of each unit to the separate Cities and allow them a large deal of autonomy in how they maintain their force."
LEC_air1:0 "Far East Air Command"
LEC_air1_desc:0 "Our 'air force' is in a terrible state. We only have old scout bi-planes, no real airfields to speak of and our airforce is led by a stunt pilot. We should at least seek to construct a proper airbase at the bare minimum."
LEC_air2:0 "'Acquire' Fighter Designs"
LEC_air2_desc:0 "Now that we have an airbase constructed we should seek to exploit our contacts, both legal and otherwise, to acquire some aircraft blueprints that we can then commission into local production."
LEC_nav1:0 "Expand the Shanghai Dockyards"
LEC_nav1_desc:0 "We have let our dockyards wither on a vine, leading to them becoming decrepit money pits fit to not even construct a rowboat. We should seek to reverse this trend and increase our naval production capabilities."
LEC_nav2:0 "Coastal Protection Vessels"
LEC_nav2_desc:0 "Now that we have breathed new life into the dockyards we should seek to begin production of Coastal Defence Vessels post-haste."
LEC_nav3:0 "Protecting our Traders"
LEC_nav3_desc:0 "Now that we have a surface navy we need to tailor our naval doctrine to our reality. Protecting our convoys at sea should be our main priority as without them, our people will starve."

### Events ###
legcities.1.t:0 "The Corruption of Officials"
legcities.1.d:0 "The Legation Cities have always been lawless, but the recent downturn in the global economy has made matters far worse. Smuggling into A.O.G. territory has increased, and the Legation Council has been unable to pay its civil servants for several months now. Many constables and customs officials are beginning to turn to the underworld for new sources of income. We have always needed to work with the secret criminal fraternities, but now it seems they are taking on more power than our government..."
legcities.1.a:0 "Do nothing"
legcities.1.b:0 "Grant the Crime Bosses positions on the Council"

legcities.1.e:0 "Pour resources into defence and clean up the corruption!"

legcities.2.d:0 "'Big Ears' Du has taken advantage of the economic difficulties in Shanghai and the other Legation Ports to become the undisputed master of the extensive criminal networks criss-crossing the autonomous cities.

legcities.3.t:0 "Criminal Activities!"
legcities.3.d:0 "AllgOstAsien-Sicherheitsamt has uncovered a frightening amount of criminal activity among the Chinese population, which is threatening the financial solvency of the Company. This is seeming to spill over from the Legation Cities, which have recently developed into hives of criminality and centres of organisation for unsavoury associations of all types."
legcities.3.a:0 "Tighten up border controls and break-up the criminal networks in our zone"
legcities.3.b:0 "Do nothing - we cannot spare the money."
legcities.3.c:0 "Dissolve the autonomy statutes of the Legation Cities!"

legcities.4.t:0 "[AOG.GetNameDefCap] is weak"
legcities.4.d:0 "Our activities in the South China have been strongly resisted by the agents of [AOG.GetNameDef]. However, we have one more possible trick to play - in the ports, we have frequently worked through transport and dockers unions. If we could encourage the workers in AllgOstAsien's factories to organise in a similar way, we could gain a firm foothold beyond the Legation Cities..."
legcities.4.a:0 "No, we shall remain in the ports."
legcities.4.b:0 "A fine idea!"

legcities.5.t:0 "Expansion along the Chinese Coast?"
legcities.5.d:0 "After much difficult struggle and organisation, our agents have gained an unparalleled position in Southern China. Through our control of political, labour and criminal organisations outside the Legation Cities, it could be possible to extend the Charter of Autonomy and engineer a transfer of control over much territory from AllgOstAsien to the Legation Council..."
legcities.5.a:0 "'Encourage' the South Chinese Coast to join our Federation!"
legcities.5.b:0 "We are happy with our invisible networks of influence".

legcities.6.t:0 "The South China Coast Breaks Away!"
legcities.6.d:0 "Criminals, corrupt officials and bought company representatives all over South China have decided to publicly throw in their lot with the underworld bosses dominating the Legation Cities!

legcities.6.a:0 "We cannot oppose them"
legcities.6.b:0 "Fight these criminals!"

legcities.7.t:0 "Fall of the Legation Cities"
legcities.7.d:0 "The armed forces of the AOG have delivered our rag-tag collections of armed tugs crushing defeat. We can either offer our surrender to AOG now, while our armed forces still exist and hope for leniency or continue with our resistance and hope for a miracle..."
legcities.7.a:0 "Surrender now"
legcities.7.b:0 "Fight till the end!"

legcities.8.t:0 "Fall of the Legation Cities"
legcities.8.d:0 "After a bloody war against the criminals based in the Legation Cities, the armed forces of the AOG are victorious! The humiliated leadership of the Legation Cities offered us their unconditional surrender in hopes for our leniency. What shall we do with the Legation Cities?"
legcities.8.a:0 "Permanent annexation will solve this!"
legcities.8.b:0 "That will suffice!"

legcities.9.t:0 "Tokyo Conference"
legcities.9.d:0 "The surprising victory over the Legation Cities and their elimination by the AOG means that the German Empire gains new sources of profits.

legcities.15.t:0 "Results of the Tokyo Conference"
legcities.15.d:0 "The conference was a complete success! All participants agreed, that in order to protect valuable international investments in Chinese ports, the Legation Cities must re-emerge as an independent international subject. Now, the A.O.G. has to free the Legation Cities!"
legcities.15.a:0 "Another success of our diplomacy!"

legcities.16.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.16.d:0 "Although the conference itself was a success, the result is harsh. Delegates agreed with the AOG's opinion that its occupation of Chinese ports will provide the best protection of foreign investments, which means that the Legation Cities will remain occupied by the AOG."
legcities.16.a:0 "Drat!"

legcities.17.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.17.d:0 "All major participants of the Tokyo conference have reached an agreement about the future status of the Legation cities.

legcities.19.a:0 "We are stronger together, make a move!"
legcities.19.b:0 "It will only make things worse."

legcities.20.t:0 "A Common Enemy"
legcities.20.d:0 "The Legation Cities have managed to send a request to our newly formed cabinet, asking us to form an alliance with them, an alliance to easier crush the German puppet! Shall we accept, or are we stronger on ourselves?"
legcities.20.a:0 "We are in a need of allies, Accept!"
legcities.20.b:0 "They will only cause trouble."

legcities.21.t:0 "The Republicans Accepted"
legcities.21.d:0 "We are not alone anymore, together we can fight off these scum, and look forward to a more brighter future."
legcities.21.a:0 "Long Live Free China!"

legcities.22.t:0 "Profits from the Legation cities"
legcities.22.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under the joint control of world powers owning interests in China. The independence of this consortium of cities was guaranteed by eight powers; Australasia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan, the French Republic, Russia and the USA. Foreign investments and the Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AllgOstAsien and Qing imperial territories. Over a decade later, our investment in the Legation cities is still paying us dividends."
legcities.22.a:0 "Let the money flow..."

legcities.23.t:0 "No Profits from the Legation cities"
legcities.23.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under the joint control of world powers owning interests in China.

Foreign investments and the Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AllgOstAsien and Qing imperial territories.

legcities.28.t:0 "Seize foreign investments?"
legcities.28.d:0 "Our armed forces have seized control over the rich and industrialised Legation cities with its large foreign investments. Several important members of the armed forces and few radical politicians suggest to seize control over foreign investments, basically to expropriate them, thus improve our fiscal conditions and deny our potential enemies additional profit. However, such act would definitively anger many important world powers, which will not look kindly to us denying them their rightful profits..."

legcities.42.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under a joint control of world powers owning interests in China. The independence of these consortium of cities was guaranteed by the major local and international powers, such as the Qing Empire, AllgOstAsien GmbH, Japan, Australia, Canada, United States and Germany. Foreign investments and Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AllgOstAsien and Qing territories. Though Russia didn't have the investments in the Legation Cities after the Weltkrieg, but now is a perfect time to get our part of the Chinese markets!"

With their power structures merged as one they have formed a united council of Dragon Heads formalising their rule over the cities. While international powers are concerned the promise of continuing trade and increased tariffs have stayed their hand for now."

legcities.46.d:0 "With the situation in Shanghai crumbling by the second a crisis meeting was called of the Legation Mandate Council to decide on what course of action to take. Lord Josslyn Errolll proposed that the Mandate itself be suspended and all legislative powers be formally invested in one Commissioner until the situation improves. A vote was called and Erroll won by a large margin. Josslyn stated in a telegram to the Mandatory Powers that full tariffs and taxes will resume and requesting their ratification of the appointment. None objected."

legcities.60.d:0 "The authority of the Legation Mandate Council has collapsed in a single night of blood and violence. Street gangs organised by the Chinese criminal organisations have slaughtered many members of the police corps, administrators and even a handful of the more influential delegates from the Legation Powers. The survivors hardly dare to leave their homes. Needless to say, with the Triads in all but complete control of all commercial activities, the payment of dividends from the Cities has ceased."

legcities.62.d:0 "The powers represented on the Legation Council have passed a resolution condemning the recent outbreak of violence in the Cities.
