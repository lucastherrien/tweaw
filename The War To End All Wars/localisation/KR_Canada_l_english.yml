CAN_iedc:0 "IEDC Investments"
CAN_iedc1:0 "IEDC Prosperity"
CAN_house_of_lords_abolished:0 "House of Lords is Abolished"
CAN_new_nobility:0 "New Canadian Nobility"
CAN_bread_basket:0 "Imperial Bread Basket"
GBR_bread_basket:0 "Canadian Food Imports"
CAN_nrc_idea:0 "National Research Council"
CAN_nrc_idea_desc:0 "The National Research Council is critical to all the research efforts in our country. With expanded funding and some political support, this allows us to boost our entire scientific community and secure the loyalty of a few important research teams."
CAN_rally_the_country:0 "Rally the Country"

CAN_work_camps:0 "Work Relief Camps"
CAN_work_camps_desc:0 "While the concept of a work camp might not be very attractive to the average citizen, it is simply better than unemployment. By providing plentiful and meaningful work, we can begin ambitious infrastructure projects while letting our people benefit directly."

CAN_howes_conversion:0 "Howe's Plan"
CAN_howes_conversion_desc:0 "The issues of our military industry in the Weltkrieg has made it patently obvious that we must promote government intervention in the arms industry. As according to C.D Howe, we will subsidise most of these factories to ensure a full economic mobilisation on the eve of another conflict and maximised production even in peacetime."

CAN_bill_c_7_debate:0 "The Bill C-7 Debate"
CAN_bill_c_7_debate_desc:0 "Certainly more than the average parliamentary debate, the Bill C-7 Debate might very well change the path of Canada for the future to come. All of the energy and influence of the political sphere is being spent in this single debate, preventing us from attending to other matters"

CAN_divided_nation:0 "Divided Government"
CAN_divided_nation_desc:0 "Our government is deeply divided on many levels and there is constant bickering between the major parties. Even outside of that, there is also a clear split between English exiles, aiming to make Canada the springboard of their reconquest of the mainland, and Canadian nationals, tired of their antics and anti-parliamentarism. This is completely paralysing our current government."

CAN_country_united:0 "Unified Government"
CAN_country_united_desc:0 "While the democratic process is alive and well, we have finally reached some sort of agreement on a common course for our country. With the fever dreams of an all-powerful English monarch doused, Canadian politicians are finally willing to support our cause."

CAN_mounties:0 "The Mounties"
CAN_mounties_desc:0 "In accordance with the Tories, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been given sweeping powers to survey and detain suspected dissidents. While many liberals now amount them to a sort of secret police, there is no doubting their efficiency in preventing unrest and dissent in our country, and any undesirable Syndicalist influences in the population."

king_new_companies:0 "New Crown Corporations"
king_new_companies_desc:0 "Strategic state investments in our country's industry allows us to rapidly and efficiently industrialise the vast Canadian lands without having to bear the responsibility of a nationalised industry. However, as the funds allocated dry up, the effects of this policy will eventually fade."

quebec_riots:0 "Riots in Quebec"
quebec_riots_desc:0 "The people of Quebec, confronted with the news of our patriotic war, have refused to defend their nation and instead have taken to the streets to protest. While some of them merely state that Canada, especially a Canada ruled by English elites, is not their nation, we know better than to believe those deserters and cowards."

anglo_french_tensions:0 "Anglo-French Tensions"
anglo_french_tensions_desc:0 "Tensions are high in Quebec as the old rivalries between Anglo-Canadians and French-Canadians continue to flare due to the exile of the English government and the generally pitious international situation of the French and English peoples. Unpopular measures like mass conscription could provoke riots, or worse."

CAN_winter_soldiers:0 "Cold Weather Training"
CAN_winter_soldiers_desc:0 "There are few places on earth with as harsh an environment as Northern Canada. We should establish barracks in the outback to serve as training utilities to accustom our soldiers to harsher climates. While this might upset new recruits, they will thank us when they see their enemies freeze to death before them without firing a shot."

CAN_superior_gunnery:0 "Quick Fire Plans"
CAN_superior_gunnery_desc:0 "While giving the responsibility of artillery strikes to commanding officers might seem like an easy answer, it can often cost armies valuable time and even cause lost opportunities. Giving the right for those who request artillery strikes to call them will allow us to make artillery support more flexible, and frankly more useful."

CAN_uranium_supply:0 "Northern Uranium Supply"
CAN_uranium_supply_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the frozen Northern lands of Canada are not just home to gold mines. Radium and Uranium have been found in absolutely massive quantities all over the Northwest Territories. We already know we will use the Radium for clocks and metres, but according to our scientists, Uranium could have an infinitely more powerful use."

CAN_cbc_idea:0 "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
CAN_cbc_idea_desc:0 "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, with the British Broadcasting Corporation subverted by the Syndicalists and the Imperial Broadcasting Corporation mostly ignored by Canadians."

CAN_aircanada_idea:0 "Trans-Canada Airlines"
CAN_aircanada_idea_desc:0 "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."

CAN_common_chassis_idea:0 "Chassis Commonality"
CAN_common_chassis_idea_desc:0 "One of the most important parts of automotive engineering is simply trying to standardise production as much as possible. By ensuring that all our motorised, mechanised and armoured divisions share the same basic chassis, we can speed up the construction of current and new designs."

CAN_common_components_idea:0 "Component Commonality"
CAN_common_components_idea_desc:0 "Ever since the breakthrough of replaceable parts, all guns have been made of the same parts to allow easy replacement and building. However, we can go one step further and ensure that all designs in one category share the same parts, and even new designs try to incorporate them, massively reducing production times of weapons and artillery pieces, new and old."

CAN_navy_school_idea:0 "Royal Roads Naval College"
CAN_navy_school_idea_desc:0 "The Royal Roads Naval College is our brand new naval officer training school. Its construction has given us some time to rethink our officer training courses, and this will probably allow us to ensure that the next generation of admirals will be the top of the cream, enough to teach the Kriegsmarine a thing or two about modern naval warfare."

CAN_asw_idea:0 "Anti-Submarine Pickets"
CAN_asw_idea_desc:0 "While submarines pose an existential threat to our convoys, we are far from defenceless against them. By dedicating certain Destroyer models to act as mobile detection platforms, we can ensure that any submarine foolish enough to prey on escorted convoys is routed or destroyed."

CAN_sub_idea:0 "Fleet Support Submarines"
CAN_sub_idea_desc:0 "Seeing their vulnerability to screening ships, having submarines engage with the rest of our navies in naval battles might seem insane. However, there are some naval doctrine concepts to be explored here. Do submarines really have to be relegated to sinking convoys, or do they have more potential?"

CAN_victory_ships_idea:0 "Victory Ships"
CAN_victory_ships_idea_desc:0 "Big battleships with naval artillery, carriers with swarms of naval fighters and submarines sending enemy supplies down into the abyss are all quite impressive, but it is none than the humble convoy that carries the backbone of our efforts. Carrying the supplies of our victory, fearless to the risks of the prowling submarine. Onwards, Victory ships!"

CAN_air_training_plan_idea:0 "Dominion Air Training Plan"
CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc:0 "Air Training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

entente_training_plan_idea:0 "Entente Air Training Scheme"
entente_training_plan_idea_desc:0 "Air Training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

CAN_loyalist_dissent:0 "Loyalist Dissent"
CAN_loyalist_dissent_desc:0 "Loyalist politicians and those who support them are in an uproar due to our recent policy decisions. They accuse us of attempting to strike right at the Crown of England, and at large against the liberation of the English motherland."

CAN_liberal_dissent:0 "Liberal Dissent"
CAN_liberal_dissent_desc:0 "Liberal politicians and those who support them are in an uproar due to our recent policy decisions. They accuse us of attempting to subvert democracy in Canada in favour of jingoistic pursuits and of generally ignoring the pleas of the Canadian people"

CAN_forts:0 "National Defence Scheme"
CAN_forts_desc:0 "Recent concerns over the stability of the United States have caused a significant push for the construction of new fortifications and the expansion of existing networks. Should push come to shove, we will ensure that any conflict in the American continent does not bleed over into Canada."

can_professional_army:0 "Quality Training"
can_professional_army_desc:0 "Some armies might pride themselves in having a lot of blokes running around with rifles, but we pride ourselves with having one of the most disciplined and organised armies the world knows. Where mass conscripted Germans and Syndicalist militias flee against a few volleys of gunfire, we stand against the fires of Hell with a stiff upper lip."

CAN_cadets_idea:0 "Mandatory Cadet Enrolment"
CAN_cadets_idea_desc:0 "As mandated by our King, all youth must serve in a branch of the Cadet Corps during their later years, ensuring that they have already received satisfactory discipline training and baseline military training by the time they are old enough to serve and fight for their beloved country."

CAN_tory_plan:0 "Tory Economic Plan"
CAN_tory_plan_desc:0 "The issues of our military industry in the Weltkrieg has made it patently obvious that we must promote government intervention in the arms industry. The Tories however want us to go even further. By nationalising large swaths of our industry, we ensure that the entire economy is mobilised and ready for another total war."

CAN_compromise_plan_idea:0 "Compromise Economic Plan"
CAN_compromise_plan_desc:0 "The issues of our military industry in the Weltkrieg has made it patently obvious that we must promote government intervention in the arms industry. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to subsidise every single last small arms factory, and instead we have reached a compromise where only the heaviest industries will receive government assistance."

CAN_stlaurent_police:0 "St. Laurent Committee"
CAN_stlaurent_police_desc:0 "The St. Laurent Committee oversees the security of our country by investigating dissidents and general unrest. While it has drawn criticism from the liberals as some sort of secret police committee, we see it as a compromise between letting Syndicalists subvert our country, and the Tories' plan for an overt secret police under the Mounties."

bishop_chief_air:0 "Chief of Air Bishop"
bishop_chief_air_desc:0 "Willian Avery Bishop has been given oversight on a plan to modernise the air force. While he is no aeronautic engineer, his plan combines increased funding in research and infrastructure. Our scientists have already begun to use our funding on new airplane projects, now we just need to start expanding and modernising our air fields."

CAN_nylon_idea:0 "Polymer Corporation"
CAN_nylon_idea_desc:0 "The Polymer Corporation is the forefront of the development of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. This, in turn, allows us to discover new, efficient ways to produce specialised equipment pieces that had until then been a nightmare for our industry to produce, like electronics, medical supplies or optics."

IRE_canaid_civ:0 "Canadian Economic Aid"
IRE_canaid_civ_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of economic aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

IRE_canaid_mil:0 "Canadian Military Aid"
IRE_canaid_mil_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of military aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

IRE_canaid_nav:0 "Canadian Naval Aid"
IRE_canaid_nav_desc:0 "We are receiving significant amounts of naval aid from Canada. No doubt is this not altruistic however, as the English don't hide their ambitions of returning to the English Isles. In the meantime, this will help us stand up against this perverted Union of Britain and their dangerous influence."

CAN_kings_speech:0 "The King's Speech"
CAN_kings_speech_desc:0 "Edward, Prince of Wales will be coronated King-Emperor as the Canadian political landscape consists of two main factions. One led by Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the other led by Conservative R.B. Bennett and the exiled British aristocracy. For now, Edward is popular in all of Canada and his endorsement could prove decisive for either faction."

### Economic Focuses ###
CAN_public_works:0 "Public Works"
CAN_public_works_desc:0 "New infrastructure and development projects and other public works will help relieve the worst, lasting effects of the Great Depression and provide valuable experience and expertise for our nascent industry. Over time, we might very well find ourselves in a new economic boom, one we will profit from rapidly."
CAN_cbc:0 "Found the CBC"
CAN_cbc_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward to expand the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission into a full-fledged national radio network called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."
CAN_production:0 "Modernise Production"
CAN_production_desc:0 "Investing in the development of new production techniques will make our industry more efficient and productive. This, in turn will help revive and revitalise our fledgling economy and ensure its long term prosperity."
CAN_polycorp:0 "Polymer Corporation"
CAN_polycorp_desc:0 "The Polymer Corporation, or Polycorp, is a crown corporation tasked with the development and production of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. These new materials will allow us to discover new ways to produce equipment that has until then proved a problem for our industry, making them cheaper and faster to output."
CAN_factory:0 "Crown Corporations"
CAN_factory_desc:0 "Enterprises founded and run by the state, so-called 'Crown Corporations', allow us to develop and maintain access to strategic resources and expertise that might otherwise by neglected or ignored by the market. Sadly, not every industrial magnate sees the use of investing in wartime resources, at least for now."
CAN_factory3:0 "National Housing Act"
CAN_factory3_desc:0 "Housing is a both a basic necessity and a major source of economic activity. By providing incentives for the construction and purchase of homes, we can create demand for key industries and promote expansion of the industrial economy as a whole."
CAN_infra:0 "CN Rail Expansion"
CAN_infra_desc:0 "Rail networks are the arteries of the nation of Canada, and none more so than the state-run Canadian National Railway. Expanding this network can only strengthen the nation, and it will surely prove crucial should we need to perform wartime supply and troops transport across the nation."
CAN_aircanada:0 "Trans-Canada Airlines"
CAN_aircanada_desc:0 "A national airline service will help unify this vast and scattered nation in a way that roads and railways cannot due to sheer size, terrain or weather. The infrastructure, organisation and training developed for this project could also have military applications in the future."
CAN_infra2:0 "Subsidise CP Rail"
CAN_infra2_desc:0 "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion. Maintaining and expanding this network will help ensure our continued control over the region, and will serve us should we ever require large-scale fret between both seas."
CAN_infra3:0 "Maritime Rail Expansion"
CAN_infra3_desc:0 "The likely site of any invasion from Europe, and the launch point of any attempt to reclaim the Home Islands, the maritime provinces and their infrastructure are a critical national security concern. We must ensure that no amount of supplies or troops going through causes issues."
CAN_resources:0 "Invest in Natural Resources"
CAN_resources_desc:0 "Much of the nation's wealth lies in its untapped natural resources. While prospecting and exploiting all those deposits hidden in Canada's wastes and wilderness will take time, we can take advantage of this natural bounty to ensure our strength and independence."
CAN_mine:0 "Explore the North"
CAN_mine_desc:0 "Before we can mine it, we have to find it. While the large forests have long been explored by civilian prospectors, only state-funded geological expeditions will dare venture into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to identify the best sites for excavation and extraction."
CAN_oil:0 "Prairie Oil Prospects"
CAN_oil_desc:0 "There has been small scale drilling in the prairies of Alberta and Saskatchewan for a while. But perhaps there is more of this critical resource waiting for those who bother to look. Perhaps we might even be sitting on fields of oil that would rival the US' current monopoly in America?"
CAN_rocketfuel:0 "Solid Propellants"
CAN_rocketfuel_desc:0 "Research into synthetic materials has yielded unexpected developments in stable solid-state combustibles. More research in this direction could be a great boon to military rocket development. This, in turn, could turn a new page of warfare, with rockets turning into the new bombers."
CAN_uranium:0 "Northern Uranium Deposits"
CAN_uranium_desc:0 "We've identified a large supply of Uranium in the Arctic regions, with the biggest pockets situated in our Northwest Territories. This resource has become critical in the developing field of atomic energy, used as a 'fuel' of sorts, and production of it on this scale will give us a leading edge in atomic research and construction. Or maybe even more."
CAN_nrc:0 "National Research Council"
CAN_nrc_desc:0 "The National Research Council was founded during the Weltkrieg to advise the Canadian government on science and research. By providing the organisation with additional funding and support we can expand our technology base to the benefit of both industry and military."
CAN_nightwatch:0 "The Night Watchmen"
CAN_nightwatch_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward by the NRC to construct a prototype radar warning system, code-name 'Night Watchmen'. In addition to its immediate strategic utility, this programme would provide enormous benefit to further research into RADAR technology and integration into air doctrine."
CAN_eti:0 "Electronics Training Initiative"
CAN_eti_desc:0 "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."
CAN_chalk_river:0 "Chalk River Labs"
CAN_chalk_river_desc:0 "Atomic technology has enormous potential to transform industry and warfare. Establishing a laboratory to develop these technologies will help ensure we maintain a competitive edge in this field. We might even achieve breakthroughs in atomic energy generation, or as some scientists suggest, discover the basics of an atomic weapon."
CAN_halifax_project:0 "The Halifax Project"
CAN_halifax_project_desc:0 "There has been enough speculation and theorising about the possibilities of atomic power. We are now certain an atomic weapon is within our reach, and we will begin a secret project to develop and deploy what might be the ultimate and most terrifying weapon ever designed: The Atomic Bomb."
CAN_colossus:0 "The Colossus Project"
CAN_colossus_desc:0 "Electronics have come a long way since the tabulating machine and the telegraph. We have developed a top secret project to build an enormous and powerful electronic computing system, primarily to assist in decrypting encoded enemy transmissions. We may even discover new applications for those computing machines, military or otherwise."

### Political Focuses ###
CAN_draft_bill_c7:0 "Draft Bill C-7"
CAN_draft_bill_c7_desc:0 "Now that he has assumed the throne, young King Edward plans his first move. By introducing bill C-7, a sweeping piece of omnibus legislation that addresses the poor state of the industry, military, and internal security, he hopes to prove himself to his new subjects. The first proposals are already on his desk for reforming the military and industry of Canada."
CAN_constitution_act:0 "The Constitution Act"
CAN_constitution_act_desc:0 "The fraud process of passing Bill C7 has revealed serious problems with the current political situation. The time has come to formalise a constitution for the nation, and clearly define the role of the Prime Minister, Parliament, and the Crown in a fully independent and Democratic Canada."
CAN_unity_government:0 "Form a Unity Government"
CAN_unity_government_desc:0 "Political division and bickering leave us vulnerable and paralysed in a worsening global environment. We should set aside our differences and come together with our opponents across the aisle to form a unified government, at least until the crisis passes."
CAN_bilingualism:0 "Official Bilingualism"
CAN_bilingualism_desc:0 "Since before the Confederation, the tensions between English-Canadians and their French-speaking counterparts have driven political strife.

CAN_kingly_prerogative:0 "Assert Royal Prerogatives"
CAN_kingly_prerogative_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, and the revolution that came in its aftermath, has revealed the fatal weaknesses of Liberalism. Now is the time to set aside frivolous pretences of equality and return power to the one divinely ordained to wield it: The King. Long live the King!"
CAN_purge_opposition:0 "Purge the Disloyal Opposition"
CAN_purge_opposition_desc:0 "Now that the parliament has been returned to the hands of the Royalists, the time has come to purge the ranks of the ministries and civil service to stifle further opposition.

CAN_social_credit:0 "Social Credit"
CAN_social_credit_desc:0 "Social Credit is an economic philosophy that was developed by Clifford Hugh Douglas during the Weltkrieg. Now that we are in power, we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalistic' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger."

CAN_rcaf_focus:0 "Expand the Air Force"
CAN_rcaf_focus_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Air force fought with distinction during the Weltkrieg, but has long since suffered from serious neglect. We can no longer afford to fall behind in this critical area of warfare, lest we cede control the sky to our foes, a terrifying prospect for sure."
CAN_national_airspace_defense:0 "National Airspace Defence"
CAN_national_airspace_defense_desc:0 "The main purpose of the air force should be to protect our land and armies from enemy aircraft and provide direct fire support for our troops on the ground. Our skies are now more than a great sight, they are new territory to defend, every single last metre of it"
CAN_strategic_power_projection:0 "Strategic Airpower Projection"
CAN_strategic_power_projection_desc:0 "The best use of our air force is to project our power over great distances, using massed bombing raids and long range fighters to take the fight deep into enemy's heartland. Their cities and factories will lie in ruins before our boys even finish driving there."

CAN_coastal_air_defence:0 "Coastal Air Defences"
CAN_coastal_air_defence_desc:0 "Canada has some of the longest coastlines of any nation on Earth, and even with the inherited Royal Navy, they can prove difficult to protect. By deploying land-based naval bombers en masse we can greatly enhance our maritime security at a comparatively low cost."
CAN_strategic_bomber_initaitve:0 "Strategic Bomber Initiative"
CAN_strategic_bomber_initaitve_desc:0 "If we hope to strike directly at our enemies overseas we will require a very powerful and long-ranged weapon. New proposals for heavy, four-engine bombers would fit that bill, allowing immense payloads to be dropped over the enemies."
CAN_advanced_fighters:0 "Advanced Fighter Design Programme"
CAN_advanced_fighters_desc:0 "Aircraft technology has been developing swiftly ever since the biplane finally bit the dust, and already our current fighter designs are starting to feel long in the tooth. It is time to run another design competition to ensure our plane frames are still the top of the cream."
CAN_jet:0 "Turbo Research Inc."
CAN_jet_desc:0 "Although an expensive and immature technology, turbojet aircraft could revolutionise aerial warfare. Let us found Turbo Research Inc. as a crown corporation to pursue this technology with all vigour. If our theorists are right, the speeds this aircraft could achieve would be beyond our comprehension."

### Military - Army Focuses ###
CAN_army_command:0 "Reorganise the Army"
CAN_army_command_desc:0 "The current Canadian army is a strange mix of a national militia surrounding a core of exiled British professionals. With war looming on the horizon, it is time to reorganise the Canadian Army into a unified fighting force, taking inspiration of the legacy of the grand British Army and her achievements in the Weltkrieg."
CAN_grand_battle_doctrine:0 "Currie's Prepared Battle"
CAN_grand_battle_doctrine_desc:0 "Arthur Currie, a respected commander of the Canadian Corps during the Weltkrieg, proposes a theory of warfare developed from his experiences on the Western Front. His approach emphasises careful planning and the close co-operation of infantry and heavy artillery to overcome enemy fortifications."
CAN_mobile_doctrine:0 "Fuller's Combined Arms"
CAN_mobile_doctrine_desc:0 "An ardent Monarchist and early advocate of mechanisation, JFC Fuller believes the static trench warfare that typified the Weltkrieg has been rendered obsolete by modern technology. Fuller proposes instead an emphasis on fast, highly mobile warfare in which tanks and motorised infantry perform breakthroughs and envelop the enemy line."
CAN_artillery_effort:0 "Artillery Effort"
CAN_artillery_effort_desc:0 "On the modern industrial battlefield, artillery is king. This much has been proven extensively in the Weltkrieg, and the guns of the interwar only get larger and scarier by the minute. We must modernise our artillery armaments if we hope to stand against our foes."
CAN_artillery_school:0 "Flexible Fire Control"
CAN_artillery_school_desc:0 "By devolving the responsibility of calling fire support missions to frontline observers, we can provide flexible and responsive artillery support to both support our attacks and blunt enemy offensives, without risking failed offensives due to overly rigid or unresponsive commanders."
CAN_heavy_tank:0 "Infantry Tank Focus"
CAN_heavy_tank_desc:0 "Our infantry will be supported in the field by heavy tanks, which will provide cover, heavy fire support, and the ability to cross or destroy enemy fortifications. In a way, the heavy tank will become the mighty centrepiece of the infantry push, calling our boys forward as they plow through the enemy."
CAN_heavy_tank2:0 "Rolling Fortresses"
CAN_heavy_tank2_desc:0 "Developed from our Infantry Tank doctrine, the Mobile Fortress takes the concept to its logical conclusion in the form of slow but incredibly well armed and armoured 'Heavy Tanks'. These are capable of stopping anything short of equally armed tanks, making our pushes slow but resilient."
CAN_infantry_equipment:0 "Improved Infantry Weapons"
CAN_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Tanks and artillery are all well and good, but at the end of the day wars are still won by the infantry. We must ensure they have adequate equipment for the job. Rifles, grenades and clothing that will allow them to perform their best while our fancier pieces clear the way."
CAN_light_tank:0 "Cruiser Tank Focus"
CAN_light_tank_desc:0 "The 'Cruiser Tank' is a fast, relatively lightly armed and armoured vehicle designed to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy line and achieve rapid advances and encirclement. In a way, it is the spiritual successor of the cavalry charge, which certainly seems to appeal to our generals."
CAN_motorized_infantry:0 "Motorised Infantry"
CAN_motorized_infantry_desc:0 "Automobile technology has come a long way since the Weltkrieg. By harnessing the opportunity of mass produced vehicles, we can field whole divisions capable of deploying rapidly and supporting fast armoured advances. Speed on foot is no longer a limiting factor in warfare, horsepower now rules."
CAN_organic_support_tech:0 "Organic Support Elements"
CAN_organic_support_tech_desc:0 "The modern industrialised army is increasingly in need of specialised support elements, like engineers and scouts, to achieve the best results in the field. We should focus effort on developing these capabilities, and ensure that they receive the best equipment we can produce."
CAN_spg:0 "Self-Propelled Guns"
CAN_spg_desc:0 "A mobile army requires mobile fire support. By mounting an artillery weapon on the same platforms as tanks we can economically provide a full range of capabilities to our mechanised divisions and provide the kind of on-point fire support that will seal the deal on most armoured pushes."
CAN_mech_infantry:0 "Mechanised Infantry"
CAN_mech_infantry_desc:0 "Developing on our experiences with motorised infantry comes proposals to build a frontline armoured troop transport, one which carries its own light armament, to support mechanised advances.

CAN_defense_one:0 "Defence Scheme No. 1"
CAN_defense_one_desc:0 "Some years ago, military planners drew up several 'Defence Schemes' to deal with potential threats from America. This one details plans to fortify the border against incursion and occupy New England and Alaska to protect our flanks. Updating it for the current situation could prove useful, especially as tensions rise in the US."
CAN_fortify_great_lakes:0 "Fortify the Great Lakes"
CAN_fortify_great_lakes_desc:0 "The Great Lakes provide a natural barrier between Ontario and the USA. All we need to do is fortify a few choke points like Windsor and Niagara to create an effective redoubt. As such, this should prove to be a simple fortification project to prevent a devastating flank in the case of an attack."
CAN_st_lawrence_line:0 "The St. Lawrence Line"
CAN_st_lawrence_line_desc:0 "The St. Lawrence river runs through the heart of the nation, and presents a logical last line of defence against American invasion. We should fortify it heavily, so that the nation is not skewered and the Quebec basin seized by American bandits."
CAN_georgian_line:0 "The Georgian Line"
CAN_georgian_line_desc:0 "The Georgian line is an incredibly ambitious plan to fortify the entire length of the 49th parallel, hopefully preventing hostile forces from bisecting the nation and encircling the heartland. This will prove to be a challenge, as the infrastructure is lacking, but this will certainly lock down any attack from the West."
CAN_maple_line:0 "The Maple Line"
CAN_maple_line_desc:0 "Anchored to Lake Champlain in the West and to the Atlantic Ocean in the East, a fortified line along the New England border could prove decisive in blocking an invasion from the East and shut down the last obvious flank near our capital."

### Military - Navy Focuses ###
CAN_navy_focus:0 "Strengthen the Navy"
CAN_navy_focus_desc:0 "If Canada is to defend itself, much less reclaim the British Homeland, it must first develop a first-rate navy. Fortunately, the legacy of the once-great Royal Navy provides a perfect foundation, and restarting from scratch allows us to get the most up-to-date navy possible."
CAN_navy_bb:0 "Support the Admiralty"
CAN_navy_bb_desc:0 "The Admiralty believes that the Battleship remains the undisputed master of the seas, and our naval strength should be arranged around protecting and supporting these massive weapons in decisive battles against the enemy fleet. Let the naval artillery roar across the Atlantic Ocean once more!"
CAN_navy_cv:0 "Support the Fleet Air Arm"
CAN_navy_cv_desc:0 "The FAA was founded soon after the Weltkrieg as the aviation arm of the Royal Navy, and its officers advocate for a new theory of naval warfare built around the aircraft carrier as the primary weapon of the fleet. Naval Bombers can threaten any fleet, and planes are starting to become a fearsome weapon of war."
CAN_dockyards:0 "National Shipbuilding Strategy"
CAN_dockyards_desc:0 "Canada's naval production capacity is barely adequate to maintain the former Royal Fleet, much less expand it back to its previous glory. A national programme of intensive shipyard expansion will be necessary to achieve naval supremacy once again and ensure our efforts do not go to waste."
CAN_navy_school:0 "Royal Roads Naval College"
CAN_navy_school_desc:0 "The admiralty has submitted a request to establish a new officer training school, to be called the Royal Roads Naval College. A site has already been selected on what was once a private estate adjacent to our facilities in Esquimalt. This will also allow us to review our current naval doctrines and training."
CAN_marines:0 "Expeditionary Warfare"
CAN_marines_desc:0 "Our most pressing threats lie across the Atlantic. We must build a military capable of taking and holding ground across the ocean, performing naval invasion operations of a scale the world has never known before. This much will become a challenge in and out of itself, but we will face it."
CAN_navy_escort:0 "Escort Focus"
CAN_navy_escort_desc:0 "Our capital ships are under constant threat of torpedo attacks from fast Destroyers and Submarines. It is critical we have a capable fleet of escort vessels to protect more expensive and vulnerable warships, creating a sort of screen in front of our valuable ships, and even being able to punish the enemy for exposing theirs."
CAN_navy_cruiser:0 "Heavy Cruiser Focus"
CAN_navy_cruiser_desc:0 "Everywhere that you can't afford to send a battleship, you send a heavy cruiser, the real workhorse of any credible naval force. We should not neglect to advance our design capabilities with ships of this type. Flexibility will no doubt be one of the new credos of the reformed Royal Navy."
CAN_navy_aviation:0 "Carrier Aircraft Focus"
CAN_navy_aviation_desc:0 "An aircraft carrier is only as useful as the aircraft it fields. If we do not invest in capable naval plans than our expensive carriers will be nothing but a very expensive, floating, useless husk of scrap metal."
CAN_navy_asw:0 "Anti-Sub Pickets"
CAN_navy_asw_desc:0 "German U-Boats proved a decisive weapon during the Weltkrieg. It is critical we improve our ability to detect these weapons and protect our capital ships and merchant marine by using specialised Destroyers loaded to the brim with cutting-edge anti-Submarine technologies."
CAN_navy_submarine:0 "Expand the Silent Service"
CAN_navy_submarine_desc:0 "The Submarine has proved to be a highly effective weapon, but has long been viewed with disdain by the traditionalists in the Admiralty and even by servicemen. We should set aside this stigma and expand our submarine corps to ensure they enjoy the same quality of officers and ships as the surface fleet."
CAN_victory_ships:0 "Victory Ships"
CAN_victory_ships_desc:0 "To supply our industry at home and armies abroad it is critical we undertake a programme of mass production of naval transports. We have already decided to do away with the Liberty class, and begun designing a new Victory class, that will indeed be essential to our efforts towards victory."
CAN_navy_bb2:0 "Modern Battleship Effort"
CAN_navy_bb2_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to stay on the forefront of battleship design. Our naval engineers have a few proposals that deserve exploration, and we should also consider implementing new modules to account for recent technological advances, like RADAR and radio stations, or heavy AA guns."
CAN_navy_cv2:0 "Modern Carrier Effort"
CAN_navy_cv2_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier has proven itself the supreme weapon of the seas. It is critical that we maintain research and design efforts to maintain this supremacy, and consider massively expanding our fleet of carriers to ensure that our planes reach every corner of the world."

### Imperialism Focuses ###
CAN_reenforce_the_empire:0 "Re-enforce the Empire"
CAN_reenforce_the_empire_desc:0 "In order to take back Great Britain from the Godless Syndicalists we need to re-enforce the dominions of the British Empire.

CAN_idec:0 "Create the IEDC"
CAN_idec_desc:0 "Suggestions have been made to form an Imperial Economic Development Corporation, to expand the industrial strength of the Empire.

CAN_irish_treaty:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
CAN_irish_treaty_desc:0 "The Irish might have an ugly history with the Empire, but they are no friends of the Syndicalists either. With the issue of Ulster long settled and the Irish having turned to us for protection from the reds, perhaps they can be enticed to pursue closer relations and we can put the past behind us."
CAN_irish_ally:0 "Alliance for Aid"
CAN_irish_ally_desc:0 "The Irish have agreed to accept our protection but have sadly stopped short of committing fully to an alliance. Perhaps if we sweeten the pot even more, we could entice them to join the Entente? There are surely a few things we can still offer other than words."
CAN_iceland_demands:0 "Demand Danish Atlantic Possessions"
CAN_iceland_demands_desc:0 "The Danes may be no threat now, but their possessions in the Atlantic could be easily be occupied and turned against us. We should move first, and gain a foothold from which we can get within striking distance of the Union of Britain."
CAN_german_treaty:0 "Treaty with Germany"
CAN_german_treaty_desc:0 "While we have our differences with the German Empire, we can not worry about old wounds right now. The focus is on reclaiming Great Britain. Thus our political leaders have suggested a treaty of non-aggression with the Germans, at least for the time being."
CAN_portugal_treaty:0 "Treaty with Portugal"

CAN_improve_social_credit:0 "Social Welfare"
CAN_improve_social_credit_desc:0 "With Liberation over, a bill has come before the Canadian government to give the people several social welfare programs.

CAN_canadian_army:0 "Modernise the Army"

CAN_canadian_nobility:0 "Canadian Nobility's Fate"
CAN_canadian_nobility_desc:0 "When the Royal Family fled Britain during the General Strike, numerous aristocrats and nobles also fled Britain to Canada.

canada.1.t:0 "The Political Situation"
canada.1.d:0 "Prime Minister King's government now has a slim majority after the defeat of R.B. Bennett's conservative party and his British backers but not all is secure. George V's health is steadily declining and, despite his sickness, continues to oppose the moderating influence of the Prime Minister on Canadian politics. Senile and obsessed with reclaiming the Empire George V lends influence to the British exiles who now sit in the Canadian House of Lords (formerly the Senate). Their presence in the upper house threatens to endanger the Prime Minister's legislative programme. While Canada has grown strong by an influx of expertise, capital and technology, it remains an uncertain player on the world stage.

Two large factions within the Canadian political sphere have coalesced, one led by the Prime Minister who seeks to develop and refine Canada's industrial strength and harvest its resources over foreign policy, and the other led by R.B. Bennett and his supporters in the British diaspora who wish to mobilise the Canadian economy to launch an invasion of the Union of Britain in the near future, even if that means accelerating arms production at the expense of civil liberties. The Prince of Wales is popular in both Anglo-Canada and French-Canada and his views may very well sway the opinions of our citizens. He could prove to be vulnerable to the arguments of either group depending on how well they make their case..."

canada.27.d:0 "Wilfred Curtis has approached the Prime Minister with a new plan to further the expansion of the air force. This proposal is even more ambitious than the plans of Bishop and would call for great reform. The problem with the proposal is that it recommends that this be a Canada first endeavour and calls for the removal of older RAF advisers from the programme to get a fresh perspective. This will lead to most of the older British advisers from the pre-revolution days being removed from offices of influence."

The vision to take back the home islands had been the predominant vision for the Canadian military but many see this as an unrealistic goal and are looking for a change to the current paradigm. Conservatives in the country still believe that retaking the isles is the best approach but the liberals are concerned that the effort to take the isles is leading Canada astray and believe that Canada comes first.

The broadcasting service has proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire towards our common goal of reviving the United Kingdom. It also serves as a tool to marginalise Syndicalism within our borders. After the debacle over Bill C-7 there have been calls to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists who are allegedly at fault for 'sabotaging' the bill. Others, noting increasing international tensions, have suggested aligning our propaganda towards a more external focus to prepare our people for the coming fight against Syndicalism."

canada.51.d:0 "The Premier of Quebec Duplessis continues to cause problems for our government. He is stirring up Quebecois national sentiment that is sure to result in social disturbances should we deploy French-Canadian conscripts in any conflict our Dominion must fight.

The recent political infighting concerning Bill C-7 has spent much of the government's political capital and preparations for a showdown with the Union of Britain claim much of Canada's resources but King feels something must be done!

canada.85.d:0 "A Syndicalist government now rules in Dublin. While this has been greeted with trepidation by the press and the general public members of our General Staff and Military Intelligence see opportunity. In their haste to subdue Collins' regime the Unionists may have created an opening that we may exploit. Support for the King remains strong in the north. Collins was unable to subdue the loyalist elements fully and the reds will likely fare no better. By secretly supplying arms and equipment to loyal factions in Ulster we could count on them once war with the Syndicalist dogs comes to rise up for our cause. In doing so they might secure for us a foothold in Ireland putting us within reach our ultimate goal: the restoration of our United Kingdom! Intelligence has also contacted several groups opposed to the new Irish government in the south. While these are no allies of Collins and his IRA they are still Republicans. They are composed of avowed anti-syndicalists and supporters of the National Centre Party and Fianna Fáil who have been forced underground. If we were to help arm and organise these disparate groups into an 'Irish National Army' it would greatly increase our chances of success but would upset members of the loyalist militias who wish for a return of the monarchy to Ireland as well as members of our armed forces for whom the memories of the Irish War are not easily forgotten."

canada.112.t:0 "Formation of an Irish Provisional Government"
canada.112.d:0 "It has been two decades since British boots stood on Irish soil, but now all that has changed with the Canadian reconquest of the Home Islands. Instead of seizing outright control of Ireland or establishing a pliant puppet regime, it appears that the restored British leadership has decided to offer us the chance to choose our own fate through a set of negotiations. A provisional government overseen by Frank McDermott has been established in Dublin, and talks with the United Kingdom look set to begin soon."
canada.112.a:0 "A chance for peace!"

canada.113.t:0 "Negotiations with Ireland"
canada.113.d:0 "As we have decided to negotiate a settlement on the Irish Question with the provisional government in Dublin, and acting from a superior negotiating position, the onus is decidedly on the restored British government to make demands. The question is, should we pursue our own interests in Ireland or propose a fair and equitable settlement with the Irish people?"

canada.113.e:0 "Offer a completely independent Irish Republic."

canada.114.t:0 "Britain Demands Ireland Joins the Entente"
canada.114.d:0 "The Crown's negotiators have laid out the British position: they want Ireland to immediately join the Entente and assist them militarily. While this could offer us the benefit of military protection and continuing rule over Ulster, indirect British control of our foreign policy would be an unfortunate outcome. Furthermore, there is no guarantee of a restored Irish Republic."
canada.114.a:0 "If they invest in our industry, it could be acceptable."
canada.114.b:0 "You people are joking, right? No way."

canada.115.t:0 "Irish Accept the Offer - with Caveats"
canada.115.d:0 "The Irish provisional administration appears to consider our offer somewhat acceptable. While it does not offer them any guarantee of a Republican restoration and would force them to join our military struggles, the offer would allow them to retain Northern Ireland and it forces us to support them. The Irish negotiators have said they will accept, so long as we sign a contract stating that we will invest in Dublin's military-industrial sector."
canada.115.a:0 "A no-brainer really. Accept the deal."
canada.115.b:0 "We have been reconsidering our position..."

canada.116.t:0 "Irish Refuse the Offer"
canada.116.d:0 "It appears that our offer was not acceptable to the Irish. Angered at the prospect of continuing British influence over aspects of their foreign policy and without guarantees of a Republican restoration, the Irish negotiators rejected our offer out of hand. It appears letting them retain Ulster was insufficient, and so we have to go back to the negotiating table with a new proposal."
canada.116.a:0 "Can't they just tell us what they want?"

canada.117.t:0 "Ireland Joins the Entente"
canada.117.d:0 "It appears that the UK government was willing to agree to our modified terms, and now the time has come for both sides to fulfill their sides of the bargain. With the negotiations over, it appears that we at least managed to get something reasonable out of the whole affair."
canada.117.a:0 "At least we keep Ulster."

canada.118.t:0 "Britain Rescinds its Offer"
canada.118.d:0 "Shockingly, it appears that our minor counter-offer was enough to irritate the British. They have rescinded their original proposal and now the negotiations are back to square one. It might be possible that the British have re-evaluated their position and are now willing to see exploit their obvious dominance in the talks."
canada.118.a:0 "Irritating."

canada.119.t:0 "Britain Demands Entente Membership and Ulster"
canada.119.d:0 "It seems that the negotiators on behalf of the British Crown are aware of their strong position in these talks, and their canny lawyers and spokespeople are proving increasingly irritating. The British are not only demanding that we join the Entente, but also that we hand over Ulster to them. While we would benefit from Entente military support, the loss of Ulster and no guarantee of a restored Irish Republic mean that this proposal is rather onerous, to say the least."
canada.119.a:0 "Military factories could make this 'deal' palatable."
canada.119.b:0 "Are the British mad? We can't accept this!"

canada.120.t:0 "Irish Accept the Offer - with Caveats"
canada.120.d:0 "While this deal is hardly fair to the Irish, they appear willing to consider it in exchange for financial investment in Dublin. It appears that even the loss of Ulster, the continuing role of the UK in their foreign affairs and a refusal to countenance an Irish Republic, were not enough to dissuade them completely. But then again, woe to the vanquished."
canada.120.a:0 "Let them have their factories."
canada.120.b:0 "Actually... let's try and extract more."

canada.121.t:0 "Irish Refuse the Offer"
canada.121.d:0 "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Irish refused the proposal completely. Outraged at the prospect of British rule in Ulster as well as the implication that no Irish Republic is on the table and that they will have to join foreign wars, Ireland told our negotiators to come back to the talks with something reasonable next time."
canada.121.a:0 "Oh well, it was worth a shot."

canada.122.t:0 "Ireland Joins the Entente and Gives Up Northern Ireland"
canada.122.d:0 "t appears that the UK government was willing to agree to our modified terms, and now the time has come for both sides to fulfill their sides of the bargain. With the negotiations over, the harshness of the terms imposed on us has become incredibly stark to everyone involved. Ulster's loss will certainly be mourned, and some foreign industrial investment hardly makes up for the humiliating loss of prestige felt by our nation."
canada.122.a:0 "At least we are independent now."

canada.123.t:0 "Britain Rescinds its Offer"
canada.123.d:0 "Despite operating from an incredibly powerful position it seems that the British have turned around and rejected our counter-offer. Even with the acceptance of continuing British dominance of Ulster it seems that the Sassenach were not satisified. This is absolutely staggering news, and the next stage of the negotiations hardly look promising for the Irish people."
canada.123.a:0 "How else can they humiliate us?"

canada.124.t:0 "Britain Offers an Irish Republic for Ulster"
canada.124.d:0 "The British have come to us with an offer that, while politically toxic to a number of prominent Irish Republicans and nationalists, given the circumstances, is not completely absurd. The UK negotiators have stated that they will liberate the Irish state completely so long as we hand over Ulster to them in perpetuity. We would not have to join the Entente, and could hopefully look forward to reasonable relations with the British in the future."
canada.124.a:0 "A reasonable offer. We accept!"
canada.124.b:0 "Ulster is Irish."

canada.125.t:0 "Irish Accept the Offer"
canada.125.d:0 "Wisely, it appears that the Irish have accepted our offer without demanding any concessions in exchange. So long as we grant them the right to form an independent Irish Republic, free of any British influence, they will hand Ulster over to us so that we may safeguard its loyalist population within our borders. All in all, the deal is sufficient for both sides to claim that they have achieved victory. The press spin battle has already begun."
canada.125.a:0 "Northern Ireland is ours!"

canada.126.t:0 "Irish Refuse the Offer"
canada.126.d:0 "It seems that the Irish have boldly refused our offer. While they did appear keen for us to leave them to conduct their Irish Republican experiment in peace, the loss of Ulster was seemingly a step beyond what they are willing to stomach as a people. The Irish negotiators are holding out for more, and it seems that we have yet to reach an agreement."
canada.126.a:0 "Those silly Paddies."

canada.127.t:0 "Britain Unconditionally Offers an Irish Republic"
canada.127.d:0 "Absolutely staggeringly, it appears that the British negotiators have come to us with an earth-shattering proposal. Stating that they are ending the negotiations early, the British Crown has offered us complete and total independence, with no strings attached. They are not even demanding Ulster for themselves, nor Irish membership of the Entente. Walking out of the meeting to scattered applause and excited, yet hushed whispers, the British delegation have returned to their hotel. The Government can hardly believe its good luck, and already mass-celebrations are erupting across Ireland. While this could be part of a stratagem, perhaps the Empire truly has changed its tune?"
canada.127.a:0 "How could we refuse this!?"

canada.128.t:0 "A Free Irish Republic"
canada.128.d:0 "Though we could scarcely believe it, it appears that the British have shown us a level of clemency and respect we have hitherto never seen before. Already British garrisons stationed on the island to protect the Provisional Government are evacuating the country from the southern ports. While we can hardly see what realpolitik goal the British have in mind, Ireland is now once again truly free!"
canada.128.a:0 "Tá ár lá linn!"

canada.129.t:0 "The Irish Happily Accept the Offer"
canada.129.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Irish were elated at the proposal we made. Our negotiators were very theatrical and publicly walked out of the negotiations, stating that the Irish were free to enjoy their liberty in front of the cameras, before returning to their Dublin hotel. Although many Irishmen are trying to figure out the catch, they are thrilled with the outcome, and much the same can be said for the exhausted people of the United Kingdom."
canada.129.a:0 "It's up to them now."

canada.130.t:0 "Irish Negotiations Over"
canada.130.d:0 "With negotiations complete the job of our distinguished team in Dublin is now finished, and they are returning home to a well-earned rest. While not everyone might have got what they wanted, the Irish Question has been settled - for now at least."
canada.130.a:0 "Good talks, gentlemen."

canada.100.t:0 "Bill C-7: The Future of Canada's Industry"
canada.100.d:0 "When the Weltrkieg began, the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith said that industry would proceed as 'Business as Usual'. The ensuing shell crisis and the difficulty found in equipping the British army have shown us that if another war were to start, we will need a mobilised war economy. However, most businessmen aren't willing to invest in specialised facilities such as Heavy Bomber factories that such an economy would require. Some Conservative MP's are proposing that part of the Security bill include a provision to immediately nationalise such key war industries. While this wouldn't increase the size of our industrial capacity, it would cut down on a lot of red tape. C.D. Howe, the minister of munitions, argues that the government subsidise the creation of such industries that entrepreneurs would lease at very preferable rates and provide the labour which would increase the number of factories, but limit their efficiency by working with the private sector. Some MP's are arguing for a compromise where the government will nationalise the specialised industries that require a great deal of sophistication while subsidising the more basic ones already in place."

canada.101.t:0 "Bill C-7: Re-Organising the Army"
canada.101.d:0 "When the revolution succeeded in Britain, it forced Canada to become the senior member of the Empire. While Canada was able to seize the West Indies, we were unable to secure the rest of the Empire and had to rely on the Australasians to secure a perimeter around their territory. Many regard this as a result of our small army at that time, and many would like resurrect the conscription bill. However, the Prime Minister is a Liberal in the mould of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and will not lightly allow such a divisive law to be promulgated without intense debate. The conservatives want universal conscription, while the progressives within the Liberal party have threatened to leave if the government goes ahead. Conscription is deeply unpopular, especially in Quebec. The Prime Minister has declared "Conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription!" Many are taking this as a sign that he is working to build a consensus."
canada.101.a:0 "Conscript every able bodied male into the B-class."

He believes that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform programme contains two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However, critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalist' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger."

While it's true that the prime minister opposed the idea of marriage on the ground of religion of king's love interest, and the fact that His Majesty's father did not agree to his son's marriage with the princess back in 1930, after the death of her first husband, sources close to the royal court indicate that real reason of resignation lies in new king ignoring Mr. Baldwin's advice in favour of Winston Churchill and Lord Beaverbrook, formerly ministers in Lord Curzon's government. Edward VIII accepted the resignation and later this day appointed Lord Beaverbrook as new prime minister of government in-exile."

Princess Isabelle, the daughter of the Orleanist Pretender, met His Majesty, at the time prince of Wales, during his visit to Algiers shortly before the British Revolution of 1925, and managed to catch his attention with her intelligence, linguistic abilities, and first-hand experience of Weltkrieg, during which she served as a nurse. The prince and the princess met again in 1927, and shortly after began their not-so-well-hidden affair, despite princess Isabelle being married and already a mother. While His Majesty didn't manage to convince his father, King George V, to allow him to marry princess Isabelle after her first husband's death in 1930, he appeared with her on several occasions after she moved to Canada in late 1930. During the time, the princess managed to win the people's support, especially in Quebec area, which proved to be very valuable for His Majesty tirelessly fighting for improving the image of the monarchy. The wedding brought support for the monarchy to new heights, and now everybody is expecting the birth of the heir!"

Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south. We are thus presented with two choices: first is to activate Defence Plan Two and move to occupy a number of strategic locations, principally the New England region, even though this will greatly upset the American government. The second option is to aid the American federal government, and perhaps even consider intervening in the war... perhaps with the eventual goal of gaining their aid in retaking the Home Islands once their civil war is over."

canada.800.t:0 "The Governor General of Canada"
canada.800.d:0 "With the King in Buckingham Palace overseeing the restoration of Royalist rule in Britain, the question has arisen regarding the King's role in Canada. During the Exile, the post of Governor-General lapsed and both George V and Edward VIII took his place directly in the structure of the Canadian government. With the attention of Edward VIII focussed on Britain, the Canadian government has quietly suggested that the post of Governor-General should be revived, though of course this in no way diminishes the loyalty of the Dominion to His Majesty. One suggestion has been to appoint the King's brother Albert as a permanent Governor-General. Alternatively, the old practice of appointing Britons to the post could be revived. Though such a decision might not be favourably received in Canada, General Brooke-Popham's name has been mentioned for the post. On the other hand, the choice could be left to the Canadian government, in recognition of their vital role in the defeat of the Union of Britain. Finally, Edward VIII could decide to retain direct personal rule of Canada, embodying in himself the eternal link between Canada and the Mother Country."

However, Edward VIII has decided to retain personal rule in Canada, suggesting that the eternal link between the two countries is embodied in his person."

After due consideration, the King has appointed his brother Albert as a permanent Governor-General. This appoint has been received reasonably well - though there was some hope a Canadian might fill the post, the Prince made a good impression in Canada during the Exile, particularly among Liberal politicians."

canada.803.d:0 "After the liberation of the United Kingdom, there were suggestions that the office of Governor-General might be revived, considering that the attention of the King would naturally be focused on reconstruction in the United Kingdom. After due consideration, the King has decided to revive the earlier practice of appointing Britons to the post. The first Governor-General is to be General Robert Brooke-Popham, a close friend of the King. The appointment has resulted in some disappointment in Canada, as there had been hopes a Canadian would fill the position."

canada.804.d:0 "After the liberation of the United Kingdom, there were suggestions that the office of Governor-General might be revived, considering that the attention of the King would naturally be focused on reconstruction in the United Kingdom. After due consideration, the King has informed the Canadian government that he will appoint whatever individual the Canadians recommend. This decision has been warmly received in Canada, as a reflection of the growing maturity of the country on the world stage, and the key role it played in the defeat of the Union of Britain. The two leading candidates are Frederick Banting, world-renowned scientist and the discoverer of insulin, and General Georges Vanier, war hero and leading figure in the Canadian military."

canada.809.d:0 "When the British Revolution happened the Canadian Senate was replaced by the House of Lords. Now however with the liberation of the British Isles, many nobles and aristocrats are moving back to the British Isles. This however has left the upper house of Canada rather empty. Two proposals have emerged as to what to do about the upper house. The first is that we should just abolish the House of Lords and become a unicameral government. The second is that we should elevate a number of new men and women to the nobility."

Their destination is a highly-guarded secret, and with them goes any remaining hope Canadians might have had that their country could be saved.
