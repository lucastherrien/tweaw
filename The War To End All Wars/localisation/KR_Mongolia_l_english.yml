mongolia.7.t:0 "Ungern Khan Descends Upon Xinjiang"

mongolia.14.b:0 "We sympathise with the Turks... rally the hordes!"
mongolia.14.c:0 "Central Asia is a waste of resources."

mongolia.32.t:0 "A New Mongolian Empire?"
mongolia.32.d:0 "Now that our cowardly enemies are defeated nobody can stop our Khan from restoring the past glory of Mongolia. With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"
mongolia.32.a:0 "Mongolia will rise again under Ungern Khan!"
mongolia.32.b:0 "We must focus on developing the Pan-Mongolian State!"
mongolia.33.t:0 "Death of von Ungern-Sternberg"
mongolia.33.d:0 "A ruthless dictator, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."
mongolia.33.a:0 "The military takes direct of the country"
mongolia.33.b:0 "Religious leaders assume control over the country."
mongolia.34.t:0 "Death of Genghis Khan II"
mongolia.34.d:0 "A ruthless autocrat, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh.

Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan, Genghis Khan's reincarnation, came to an end. The new era of Mongolia has begun - but there is still the question about the future of this era. Some conspirators want to rule the country behind the back of new monarch - Ungern's wife or his little son, while some of them want to form a military government. Mongolia is at the crossroads of history once again."
mongolia.34.a:0 "Zhelne Khatun shall rule the country. Under supervision..."
mongolia.34.b:0 "Genghis Khan III shall rule. Under supervision..."
mongolia.34.c:0 "Military takes direct control of the country."
mongolia.35.t:0 "A Second in Command for Ungern Khan?"
mongolia.35.d:0 "Today newspapers around the world has been filled with the news of the assassination of the Russian president, Alexander Kerensky. Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"
mongolia.35.a:0 "Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man!"
mongolia.35.b:0 "Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, the Mongol noble!"

mongolia.36.d:0 "After hard fighting, we have at last subdued this pathetic Shangqing regime! The Khan is pleased with our victories that glorified his rule and made our beloved Mongolia much stronger and larger. There is much to reward ourselves and soldiers here,including captured enemy supplies. How should the new populace, and these resources, be dealt with?"
mongolia.36.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.36.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."
mongolia.37.t:0 "Annexation of Tibet"
mongolia.37.d:0 "Tibet is now under hooves of our horses...But we should remember our long friendship and cooperation with this people. Their government will be punished for their betrayal, but citizens of Tibetan mountains will probably agree to join our Empire under the rule of glorious Genghis Khan II! Tibetans know how to fight in the ice hills, and their soldiers will be beneficial to our mighty armies...But warriors of the Khan want to be rewarded for long bloody battles..."
mongolia.37.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.37.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."
mongolia.38.t:0 "Dealing with the Lhasa Regime"
mongolia.38.d:0 "Tibet always enjoyed cordial relations with Mongolia, but once they heard about the restoration of our Great Empire, the cowardly government in Lhasa turned their back upon Ungern. The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."
mongolia.38.a:0 "Ungern Khan shall unite ALL Buddhists! Onward!"
mongolia.38.b:0 "We have enough Lamas in Urga."
mongolia.39.t:0 "Bringing Down the Shangqing Tianguo"
mongolia.39.d:0 "With Xinjiang and Tibet incorporated into our Empire we have one more enemy to beat – the Millenarian state of the Shangqing Tianguo, where a lot of Mongolic tribes live under Chinese oppression. Nomadic peoples want to recognise Genghis Khan II as their one and only ruler - that means that war is unavoidable. Soon the banner of Ungern Khan and the restore Mongol Empire!"
mongolia.39.a:0 "The God of War Reincarnated shall ravage Yan'an!"
mongolia.39.b:0 "It'd be a Long March..."
mongolia.40.t:0 "Tribal Revolt!"
mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors". Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes..."
mongolia.40.a:0 "The rebellious tribes topples the regime!"
mongolia.40.b:0 "The tribal revolt is crushed!"
mongolia.42.t:0 "Bringing Down the Yunnan Warlords"
mongolia.42.d:0 "With Xinjiang,Tibet and Shangmongolia incorporated into our Empire we have one more enemy to beat – the rebel state of the Yunnan Warlords, these lands once belonged to the Mongol Empire and they will at the end be ruled once more by us, they're rightful owners."
mongolia.42.a:0 "The God of War Reincarnated shall ravage Yunnan!"
mongolia.42.b:0 "It'd be a far too Long March..."

mongolia.45.t:0 "German Territories"
mongolia.45.d:0 "Maybe it's time to deal with our last enemies in China, the concessions and colonies still held directly by Germany. Now that we have reconquered the people of the plains, China doesn't need the Kaiser's help anyway."
mongolia.45.a:0 "It's time to seize them!"
mongolia.45.b:0 "Perhaps we should reconsider..."
mongolia.46.t:0 "Mongolia Attempts to Seize Our Colonies!"
mongolia.46.d:0 "Last night the Mongolian Empire moved troops across the border into our cities along the coast! They are claiming ownership and demanding that we back down before they invade Indochina!"
mongolia.46.a:0 "We cannot afford a war halfway around the world"
mongolia.46.b:0 "The Kaiser will not stand for this INSULT!"
mongolia.47.t:0 "Germany Accepts"
mongolia.47.d:0 "Germany accepted our demands and gave back our rightful territories. It's an important step in reuniting the Mongol Empire under the rule of the glorious Von Sternberg dynasty."
mongolia.47.a:0 "Welcome home."
mongolia.48.t:0 "Status of Macau"
mongolia.48.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macau became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Now that the South lies in the hands of the Mongolians once more, the khan is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Mongols."
mongolia.48.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
mongolia.48.b:0 "Let the idea slide."
mongolia.49.t:0 "Mongol Demands"
mongolia.49.d:0 "After centuries, the Mongol Khan now decided to demand Macau from us. The Mongol Empire is now one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them is probably not a good idea."
mongolia.49.a:0 "We have no choice."
mongolia.49.b:0 "They will have to fight for it!"
mongolia.50.t:0 "Concessions For Peace?"
mongolia.50.d:0 "The war with Fengtian has so far been unsuccessful, and our enemy now occupies Chahar. Many within our government urge peace, lest our nation be reduced to rubble. To that end, we can offer Fengtian control of Chahar and Suiyuan in exchange for peace."
mongolia.50.a:0 "Make the offer."
mongolia.50.b:0 "Chahar is Mongolian."
