### Events ###
russia.1.t:0 "A Troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a:0 "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1918"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1918, roughly a year after the fall of Nicholas II, the Russian constitution defines the country's political institutions. The legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate, consisting of senior nobles, statesmen, and scholars. The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."
russia.2.a:0 "The constitution guarantees freedom and stability!"

russia.2017.t:0 "The Russian Economy"
russia.2017.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War in early 1920, the Kerensky government attempted to recover the economy using a mix of socialist economic theories and the propositions of the Kadets and its supporters among the Russian capitalists. Kerensky recognised the de-facto redistribution of the land among the Russian peasants and restored private land ownership. Using the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which during the Civil War was under Kolchak's control and later was transferred to Petrograd, Kerensky introduced a new currency and launched the 'New Economic Policy', NEP, which allowed him to recover the Tsarist industry, including the military plants, and involve American investments in the various branches of the Russian economy. However the slowing growth of the economy as well as the intensification of the confrontation between the right and left parts of the Russian establishment led to the recession in 1933. It is clear that the Russian industry still has great potential, which can strengthen the economy as well as the international position of the country."
russia.2017.a:0 "We should strengthen the economy."

russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans forced us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, the Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Aleksandr Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than increasing property taxes. Even if the increase in taxes will primarily anger the bourgeoisie, the other cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support.

russia.4.d:0 "With stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions of our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash, only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Aleksandr Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

However, he also understands that without an efficient political programme, his control over the country will be lost and the left Social-Revolutionaries will plunge Russia into terror and chaos. The temporary prime-minister, General Lukomsky, a well-known supporter of Kornilov can maintain a similarity of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the Senate and Duma. As a result, Kornilov has decided to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia), into the government and offer him the post of Prime-Minister. Though Savinkov and Kornilov are not on the best of terms, Kornilov hopes that Savinkov will be able to reconstruct the glory of the Russian state."

russia.37.t:0 "Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
russia.37.d:0 "Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, has played a very important role in Russian politics since the end of the civil war. Between the years 1917-1920 he gained control over the rightist part of the Social-Revolutionary Party and renamed it the 'People's Republican Party of Russia', which under his leadership did its best to fight separatism throughout the country, propose radical laws to improve the position of the peasants and support pro-Russian movements in the German satrapies, carved out of the territories of the former Russian Empire by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. A talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal."

The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."

With Kornilov gone nothing stands in the way of Savinkov merging the posts of prime minister and president and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted 'Da' (Yes). Savinkov now rules a potent and aggravated nation, ready to shed itself of the many humiliations faced since the Weltkrieg and step into the sun once more. The Vozhd commands!"

russia.40.d:0 "With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first 'Prikaz Vozhdya'). Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and a full-blown branch of the government."
