### Events ###
socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the fall of Rome in 1919, an exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Austrians, seemingly destined to be divided again into her old pre-unification states. Mere hours after the humiliating announcement of capitulation, enraged nationalists proclaimed a new Republic of Italy in Milan, and that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. However, not so far away in Torino, The Socialist Republic was proclaimed just days later. Austria's plans for dividing Italy were quickly torn to pieces.\n\nAs Civil war erupted throughout the region, the Socialist Republic of Italy gained seemingly unstoppable momentum, broken only by a staunch defence of the Po by forces of the Republic of Italy and Austria; ushering in a period of deadlock.\n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, Three Congresses have come and gone that have helped to bring the revolution throughout the region under their control, uplifting many from their previous conditions though much still remains to be done. The Italian support in creating the Third International has many looking to complete Risorgimento and reunify Italia once more."

### Fourth Congress ###
socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacalista seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Unione Socialista Cristiana desire a government that helps the people, and supporting Christian socialism. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Unione Socialista Cristiana advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes.

While Mussolini's Unione Nazionalista demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a:0 "We must expand our agriculture"

socitaly.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. The Unione Sindacalista's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Unione Socialista Cristiana's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead.

The Unione Nazionalista, on the other hand, are claiming that Christianity is archaic, unsuited for the modern age and that State Atheism will help break the chains of ignorance.

While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must look at how to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first favoured by the Unione Socialista Cristiana would focus on the various communes throughout the country and focus on decentralising the industry. The second plan put forth by the Unione Nazionalista is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale(Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions to bring prosperity to the people."

However, with many seeking to reunify Italy again, a plan has been put forth to reform the Red Guards into the Red Army.

A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture.
