turkestan.1.t:0 "The Hour is at Hand!"
turkestan.1.d:0 "We are now at war with the infidels in Kazakhstan. Should we send out a call to all of the Turkmen tribes to engage in a Holy War?"

The Council of State is now deliberating on who will be the next supreme ruler of the country: will the Emir's son, Crown Prince Shahmurad, inherit his father's position? Will the ambitious Ibrahim Bek be able to finally assume supreme power in Turkestan? Or will the shadowy clerical faction under Mufti Ishan Babakhan triumph?"
turkestan.13.a:0 "Crown Prince Shahmurad assumes power"

turkestan.14.d:0 "Shahmurad Alim Khan, the Emir of Bukhara and grand Head of State of the Islamic Federation of Turkestan, introduces the mechanical horse to the sceptical people of Turkestan. The Emir first encountered the internal combustion engine on a visit to Berlin and very quickly realised that the horse had had it's day. Once crowned Emir, Shahmurad Alim Khan became a relentless promoter of the engine to his people and more specifically it's military."
turkestan.14.a:0 "Crown Prince Shahmurad assumes power"

turkestan.15.t:0 "Fundamentalism in the Islamic Federation of Turkestan"
turkestan.15.d:0 "Following our latest series of conquests, the shadowy clerical faction of our Council of State, under the leadership of Grand Mufti Ishan Babakhan, has called for a formal adoption of several aspects of sharia law in the country, and also for even more aggressive expansionist projects. They also aim to question and confront the religious authority of Ottoman Caliph in Istambul, a move which would increase Turkestan's relevance in the world stage..."

turkestan.16.c:0 "Abandon all plans and reduce clerical influence in the Council"

turkestan.17.t:0 "The Supreme Authority of Sunni Islam"
turkestan.17.d:0 "Since 1517, the Ottoman Sultans has held the title of Caliph, as spiritual rulers of Sunni Islam. Even if the title has been historically disputed many times and the Sultan's religious authority is slim outside Turkey, the position of Caliph has great symbolic importance. By breaking any spiritual ties to the Ottoman Caliphate, we will have free reign to further expand our interests. One possible move would be arranging a resurgence of the rival Sharifian Caliphate, headed by the Hashemite Dynasty."
turkestan.17.a:0 "The Sultan still has much influence, we shouldn't break those ties."
turkestan.17.b:0 "Contact the Hashemites, attempt to restore the Sharifian Caliphate."
turkestan.17.c:0 "Establish a new Caliphate in Bukhara."

turkestan.18.t:0 "The Sharifian Caliphate"
turkestan.18.d:0 "The Caliphate, currently based in Constantinople, is the traditional leadership of Sunni Muslims worldwide. Despite formal submission to the Ottomans, the Sharif of Mecca has been, since the 10th Century, a Hashemite. Based on this fact, the idea of proclaiming a Sharifian Caliphate has been gaining ground lately. Now, as the Turkestani have broken their symbolic ties to the Ottoman Caliph, they have approached us with a proposal to establish a Caliphate based in Arabia..."
turkestan.18.a:0 "We should not upset the Ottomans any further"
turkestan.18.b:0 "Accept their proposal and establish a new Caliphate"

turkestan.19.t:0 "The Hashemites Refuse"
turkestan.19.d:0 "The House of Hashim, out of fear from Ottoman Reprisals, has refused our proposal to establish a Sharifian Caliphate rivalling Constantinople. Those cowards... Our clericals have come up with a much more interesting idea: establishing our own autonomous Caliphate in Bukhara."
turkestan.19.a:0 "We should take care of our internal issues instead"
turkestan.19.b:0 "Establish a new Caliphate in Bukhara"

turkestan.20.t:0 "The Hashemites Accept"
turkestan.20.d:0 "The House of Hashim has accepted our proposal and have established a new Caliphate in Arabia, rivalling the Ottomans in Constantinople. We may have crippled a bit of the Ottomans' prestige, but it will not come cheaply..."
turkestan.20.a:0 "Great!"

turkestan.21.t:0 "Establishment of the Sharifian Caliphate"
turkestan.21.d:0 "The House of Hashim, reminding the world of their role as Sharifs of Mecca since the 10th Century and their descendancy from Prophet Muhammed himself, have declared the Ottoman Sultan as unfit to act as Caliph of All Faithfull and proclaimed a new Sharifian Caliphate. Abdullah bin Ali, head of the Hashemites, has proclaimed himself as Caliph of all Sunni Muslims, a move which will surely rise Arabia's status in the world stage, but shall also upset the Ottomans very much..."
turkestan.21.a:0 "Great!"

turkestan.22.t:0 "A Rival Hashemite Caliphate"
turkestan.22.d:0 "Based on a proposal from Turkestan, the House of Hashim, reminding the world of their role as Sharifs of Mecca since the 10th Century and their descendancy from Prophet Muhammed himself, have declared the Ottoman Sultan as unfit to act as Caliph of All Faithfull and proclaimed a new Sharifian Caliphate. Abdullah bin Ali, head of the Hashemites, has proclaimed himself as Caliph of all Sunni Muslims. What an outrage! We demand an immediate intervention to correct this grave insult against Islam!"
turkestan.22.a:0 "The Hashemites must be removed from Arabia"
turkestan.22.b:0 "Ignore them, no true Muslim will accept their mock Caliphate"

turkestan.23.t:0 "Ottoman-Hashemite War"
turkestan.23.d:0 "After the House of Hashim proclaimed the establishment of the Sharifian Caliphate, the decadent Ottoman Sultan declared war on our brothers. We now have the moral duty to support them against the invaders from Constantinople!"
turkestan.23.a:0 "For Islam, join their struggle"
turkestan.23.b:0 "We are not ready for a war against the Ottomans"

turkestan.24.t:0 "An offer from Turkestan"

Our Grand Mufti Ishan Babakhan has proclaimed himself as Caliph of all Sunni Muslims, a move which will surely rise Turkestan's status in the world stage, but shall also upset the Ottomans very much..."
turkestan.25.a:0 "Great!"
