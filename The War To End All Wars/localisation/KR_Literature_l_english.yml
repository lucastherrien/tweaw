literature.2.d:0 "The history of French literature is unique. It is comprised of centuries of great masterpieces, which deliver to the reader ultimate feelings. The newest book, promoted very hard by the Arts' Highest Bureau, is about a Catholic priest who, after new acts on religion are passed after Second Revolution, comes to a village and tries to spread the word of God. Unfortunately, the government has sent a young syndicalist activist to teach the village about the blessings of Marxism, as well. Soon, a love triangle forms between the priest, the agitator and the daugther of a wealthy Kulak. The story ends on a happy note, as the priest loses his faith and becomes a mechanic, and the agitator and the girl start new happy life together with Marx. Critics from non-syndicalist countries say that this is an utter piece of propaganda and that the story it tells is rubbish, however, the common folk of Syndie France are taking quite a liking to it."

However, just when they finish high school, Japan is readying herself for war, and the boy is called to join the Navy. The two have to part from each other, Marin staying at home. Only now that they're seperated, they notice their feelings for each other, but struggle to express them in the few letters they can exchange. Just when the war draws to a close, and Marin yearns for her loved one's return, his letters stop coming.\n\nWhile the book does not represent the highest of Japanese literature, it gives an astonishingly detailed insight to both the daily lives of a farmer's daughter in rural Japan and of a Japanese Navy Marine. The book is scheduled to be translated to German, English and Russian."

literature.14.d:0 "Ernst Jünger, one of our accomplished generals, is also a successful author. Today his newest book came out in the homeland: Auf den Marmorklippen, on the Marble Cliffs. It's a novel full of sometimes obscure symbolism, magic and the inner, hidden workings of life itself. Set in a fantasy world, the rich, art-loving civilisation of Marina is living in peace next to the martial nomads of the steppes. Two brothers are the protagonists of the story who try to stop the Oberförster, the Chief Ranger, from slowly overtaking the beautiful town of Marina. More and more nomads are listening to the Oberförster, who acts jovial it first, but soon proves to be a cold, power-hungry murderer. The people of Marina are stopping to listen to their poets, their values and spirit decay. When the two brothers find a cabin in the woods where the Oberförster's henchmen murder their victims, they try to rise up against the villain, but to no avail. Only their magic allows them to escape. They have to set fire to their house on the cliffs of marble and their life's work watching the city of Marina burn on the horizon, returning to a state of fatalism.The book has gained mixed reviews. While some praise it for it's elaborate aesthetics and the insight in the way the world works, some readers more interested in the political implications of the Marmorklippen are wondering if it is supposed to be Ernst Jünger's commentary on the harsh reality of Mittelafrikan politics. Jünger himself didn't comment on it, but his brother Friedrich Georg, a poet, said that it's a shoe that fits various feet'."

literature.15.t:0 "The Blue Lotus"
literature.15.d:0 "The newest comic of Georges Rémi, or Hergé, takes place in the Qing Empire where the reporter Tintin is sent to dismantle drug trafficking. It is known that Hergé was helped in his work by a young student from the legation city of Shanghai named Zhang Chongren who came in Flanders-Wallonia to study fine arts. The expertise of Zhang led to a striking and realistic representation of Chinese society and contributed greatly to the enormous success of the book in the Reichspakt and China. The book criticises the weakness and the corruption of the Qing government as well as the Japanese presence in Manchuria and is as such, banned in both of these countries. Fortunately the Kaiserreich allows free speech, it would have been a shame to miss this work of art!"
