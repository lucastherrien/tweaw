tuva.4.t:0 "The Kyzyl Airport"

tuva.4.a:0 "Build the Airport"
tuva.4.b:0 "We can't afford this"

tuva.5.t:0 "The Smuggler Problem"
tuva.5.d:0 "For years, Tuva has been a hub for smugglers on a route that extends from the Trans-Siberian railroad in the north to Shanghai in the south, linking East Asia with Europe. Supported by the Mongolian government, Kyzyl became an important stopping point along this route. Recently, a coalition of smugglers banded together to meet with Ondar, ready to discuss the future of smugglers and bandits in Tuva."

tuva.5.b:0 "Sternberg is dead, and we'll never support renegades!"

tuva.6.t:0 "The Kyzyl Airport"
tuva.6.d:0 "There has been great concern amongst the smugglers and local representatives in Kyzyl to create a national airport. Both see it as an ample reason to expand the economy and strength of the nation. The smugglers especially are very ambitious people. It would be unwise to upset them..."
tuva.6.a:0 "Build the Airport."
tuva.6.b:0 "We don't have the resources now."

tuva.7.t:0 "The Irkutsk-Kyzyl Syndicate"

Recently, the same powerful group of smugglers, thugs, and bandits who pushed for the creation of the Kyzyl airport have officially formed an alliance, called the Irkutsk-Kyzyl syndicate, after their two primary places of operation. Rumours are abound that our leader Ondar is playing a heavy hand in the rise and protection of all of this thuggery."
tuva.7.a:0 "Their success is our success."

tuva.8.t:0 "Increased smuggling activity in Siberia"
