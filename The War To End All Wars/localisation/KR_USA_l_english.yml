### Ideas ###
USA_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis; the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

USA_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next President knows when this can be over."

USA_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5:0 "Nearly-Full Recovery from the Civil War"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country.

### Events - Pre Election ###

ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Although able to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, which allowed its prosperity to continue well into the 1920s, German victory in the Weltkrieg, followed by the French and British Revolutions, led to the Wall Street crash of 1925. This sent the United States spiraling into the Great Depression and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy, and by 1936 the country had spent over a decade in the midst of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fueled the rise of radical parties in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, to the far-right America First Party. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."
ustates.1.a:0 "God Save America"

ustates.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits America"
ustates.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1925. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
ustates.2.a:0 "This is just not our year."

ustates.3.t:0 "The Coalition Ticket?"
ustates.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America or the America First Party would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed within the halls of power to form a coalition ticket between the Republican and Democratic Parties with Progressive Senator Floyd Olson of Minnesota as the presidential candidate. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength."
ustates.3.a:0 "Form the Coalition"
ustates.3.b:0 "Do not form the Coalition"

ustates.4.t:0 "Southern Democrats Complain"
ustates.4.d:0 "Although the coalition is showing signs of success, there is already some dissent from the various factions. The loudest voices belong to those of the Southern Democrats, many of whom are much more conservative and are facing stiff competition from the America First Party candidates. The coalition has been largely dominated by Northern Democrats and Republicans, with the Progressives being the third wing of the coalition. We could try and force a compromise by promising to appoint southern Democrats to the cabinet and other positions of power if we win. Of course, we could also ignore their protest and focus on winning the election instead."
ustates.4.a:0 "Let them complain, where else will they go?"
ustates.4.b:0 "Promise to appoint them to the cabinet"

ustates.5.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
ustates.5.d:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have long been at odds since they came to national prominence. As we try to keep our coalition party together, a number of Democrats and Republicans have been getting into verbal shouting matches in Congress. While they are just minor members, the conflict could destabilize the whole coalition if it is allowed to spread. We can either come down hard on one side, or try to force some kind of compromise by pressuring rabble rousers to keep still until after the election – either way, it should end public dissent for now."
ustates.5.a:0 "Side with the Democrats"
ustates.5.b:0 "Force a compromise"
ustates.5.c:0 "Side with the Republicans"

ustates.6.t:0 "Olson's Nomination"
ustates.6.d:0 "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican, Democratic and Progressives Parties, Senator Olson himself came out to accept his nomination as the Coalition presidential candidate. This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
ustates.6.a:0 "Let us pray that this helps us"

ustates.7.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
ustates.7.d:0 "In Iowa, a number of Progressives have gotten into a conflict with the Republicans. The Republicans are accusing the Progressives of alienating people needed to win the election while the Progressives are accusing the Republicans of not pushing for the policies needed to end the Depression. This fighting is driving a wedge in the coalition."
ustates.7.a:0 "Side with the Republicans"
ustates.7.b:0 "Force a compromise"
ustates.7.c:0 "Side with the Progressives"

ustates.8.t:0 "Nominating Quentin Roosevelt"
ustates.8.d:0 "Since the nomination of Senator Olson as the presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumours to rest, Quentin Roosevelt was announced as the VP for the coalition ticket yesterday in New York City. In his announcement, he emphasized wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through a plan called the Fair Deal. Though this plan was denounced by the SPA and AFP as being nowhere near enough to help the average American, economists believe that it may be enough to end the Depression"
ustates.8.a:0 "A deal that is fair and a deal that is square"

ustates.9.t:0 "Indian Citizenship Act"
ustates.9.d:0 "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizenship. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
ustates.9.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
ustates.9.b:0 "Veto the Bill"

ustates.10.t:0 "The Coalition falls apart!"
ustates.10.d:0 "The conflicts within the Coalition party have spiraled out of control and today it seems that the coalition party cannot stand together in Congress. The Republicans, Democrats and Progressives have all gone their separate ways back to their old rhetoric. The ever-present Capitol rumour mill has it that General Douglas MacArthur could save America, should either Reed or Long take over."
ustates.10.a:0 "God save America, for nobody else can…"

ustates.11.t:0 "Increasing Radicalization"
ustates.11.d:0 "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the radical AFP and SPA throughout the country. The party machine of these radicals utilizes mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Reed or Long."
ustates.11.a:0 "This is really bad"

ustates.12.t:0 "Progressives flock to the SPA"
ustates.12.d:0 "Minnesota, which has long been a bastion of the Progressive Senator Floyd Olson, has finally flipped. Many people are turning away from Senator Olson on the direction of the IWW and SPA. Various Unions have held rallies for the SPA, and attendance far outstrips our ability to counter them."
ustates.12.a:0 "Roll the Union on."

ustates.13.t:0 "Southern Democrat voters align with the AFP"
ustates.13.d:0 "The South has long been considered the heartland of the Democratic Party, but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in voter registration for the AFP. On a radio broadcast, Huey Long spoke at length about Share Our Wealth and his plans for America. It seems that the AFP is growing stronger by the day."
ustates.13.a:0 "Hurray Boys for the red white and blue"

ustates.14.t:0 "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
ustates.14.d:0 "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with an armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington D.C. While the plan has obviously not been endorsed or made public, we at least have it as a contingency."
ustates.14.a:0 "Let us hope this is not needed"

ustates.15.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"
ustates.15.d:0 "In Detroit, Michigan, the automotive capital of the world, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankenstein, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for 'Unionism, Not Ford-ism', demanding higher pay and fewer hours for automotive workers.\n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
ustates.15.a:0 "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"

ustates.16.t:0 "Representatives Retiring"
ustates.16.d:0 "Many Republicans and Democratic Representatives have announced that this year will be there last year in Congress. While many retirees claim old age motivated them, rumors of gang intimidation by SPA and AFP Congressmen reminds many of the Congressional brawl between Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks. The unprecedented rate of their retirement has given hope to the AFP and SPA that they can win these open elections."
ustates.16.a:0 "Let us hope they get good replacements"

ustates.17.t:0 "Violence between the SPA and AFP"
ustates.17.d:0 "In a number of major cities, conflicts between supporters of the America First Party and the Socialist Party have broken out in violence. Fist fights and even shooting are starting to become a regular occurrence throughout the country as the country spirals ever deeper into chaos."
ustates.17.a:0 "This is just not our year"

ustates.18.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin's CBS Radio Broadcasts"
ustates.18.d:0 "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin began a weekly radio broadcast in America, and now has an audience of over 50 million people. He is a raving anti-Semite, who claims that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fomented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so that his hateful message cannot reach the public."
ustates.18.a:0 "Coughlin is a becoming a danger to the public, shut him down"
ustates.18.b:0 "I hate what he says, but I defend his right to say it."

ustates.19.t:0 "Huey Long Speaks"
ustates.19.d:0 "The Democratic Party and the Republican Party were just like the old patent medicine drummer that used to come around our county. He had two bottles of medicine.

And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of 'em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down — when I got to Congress."

Jack Reed also spoke at the funeral ending his speech with some of Haywood's quotes, 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight.

Then, overnight, heavy rain caused the water to rise even higher, and on March 18, the water peaked at about forty-six feet, twenty-one feet above the flood stage.\n\n This is the worst such disaster in the city's history, and local authorities have already requested federal aid."

The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion.

Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security.

To most of Reed's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed, and moved to nationalize the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil, whose case against Executive Order 7089 was still pending.

Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Reed has asked Senator Majority Leader Meyer London to remove the filibuster for judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional.

ustates.76.d:0 "The troops that arrived to support the National Guard found themselves in a war zone.

ustates.77.t:0 "Long and Reed Argue"

ustates.81.t:0 "MacArthur proposes assassination of Long."
ustates.81.d:0 "MacArthur privately met with the President today and made a shocking illegal proposal, the assassination of Huey Long. Analysis of reports from spies from within the America First Party indicated that the entire movement would tear itself apart without his charismatic leadership, and while it might lead to extensive rioting, it was definitely preferable to an organized uprising, which appeared more and more likely as the days wore on. The President's closest friends however advise him against this, as it could set a deadly precedent for dealing with rivals in politics."

### Garner Path ###

ustates.86.t:0 "The Inaugural Address of John N. Garner"
ustates.86.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. He promised that the economy shall be fixed and that democracy is a non-negotiable and integral part of the nation. Garner enters the White House surrounded by allies, professing that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
ustates.86.a:0 "God Save America"

ustates.87.t:0 "Federal Involvement in the Strike"
ustates.87.d:0 "Since Garner's election, the CSA with the support of Reed and the SPA launched a General Strike to oppose the results of the election. By Inauguration day the strike had been going on for nearly two months and no one had devised a way of ending the strike. Garner and many within the Democratic party have come to believe that a strong hand is needed to stop the strikers."
ustates.87.a:0 "Federal involvement is necessary."
ustates.87.b:0 "Federal involvement is not necessary."

ustates.88.t:0 "Tension in the Steel Belt"
ustates.88.d:0 "As National Guardsmen arrived in the North to end the strike, tension remained high. Many of the various mayors and even governors were not just supportive of the Strike but actively helping it. Consequently, they strongly opposed the use of the National Guard. The strikers began to taunt the guards and have even assaulted scab workers. It is clear a single spark can set off the North. Yet President Garner remained undeterred by this and declared on the radio that the strike must end for the good of the nation, with the unsaid implication that force is going to be used if it doesn't."
ustates.88.a:0 "The strike will end, I promise you"

ustates.89.t:0 "Striking in the South"
ustates.89.d:0 "The General Strike launched by the CSA has reached even the south with textile workers joining in the strike and launched their own strikes across the south, as well as in the rest of the country. With the Chaos in the steel belt, President Garner had to make a choice. Should he divert force to stopping the strike in Tennessee or in North Carolina."
ustates.89.a:0 "The Strike shall end in Tennessee"
ustates.89.b:0 "The Strike shall end in North Carolina"

ustates.90.t:0 "Minutemen establish control in Tennessee"
ustates.90.d:0 "With the country falling further into chaos, Long had the Minutemen move into Tennessee to establish order out of chaos. As Long established order there it is clear that the state is more loyal to him now than to the Federal government."

ustates.91.t:0 "Minutemen establish control in North Carolina"
ustates.91.d:0 "With the country falling further into chaos, Long had the Minutemen move into North Carolina to establish control and order there. As Long established order there it is clear that the state is more loyal to him now than to the Federal government."
ustates.91.a:0 "Never should have come there, Long!"

ustates.92.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
ustates.92.d:0 "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving 5 dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the Pittsburgh Massacre and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with armed strikers throughout the steel belt."
ustates.92.a:0 "Who gave them guns? Guns are for us"

ustates.93.t:0 "Local Police are Ineffective"
ustates.93.d:0 "Whether due to loyalty to the CSA or just being overwhelmed, local authorities have been ineffective at dealing with Reed and the CSA. Information out of the Steel Belt is becoming more and more vauge. The General Strike had locked down more of the industrial base."
ustates.93.a:0 "If you can't rely on your fellow American...."

ustates.94.t:0 "Governor of Missouri Asks America First for Help"
ustates.94.d:0 "When the CSA strike took hold in St. Louis the city came to a halt. The Federal government had not been willing to become involved and the Governor of Missouri asked for help from the America First to end the strike."

ustates.95.t:0 "The America First Minutemen Arrive in St. Louis"
ustates.95.d:0 "Long's Minutemen arrived in St. Louis and were greeted with cheers from the crowds as they marched through the city.

ustates.95.a:0 "Demand Long remove the Minutemen"

ustates.96.t:0 "Long Refuses to Remove the Minutemen"
ustates.96.d:0 "Long refused to remove the Minutemen, citing his invitation from the Governor of Missouri. Garner insisted that the Minutemen leave and that Long return control to the local authorities. Long's refusal was a challenge to the President's authority."
ustates.96.a:0 "Send in the army to remove the Minutemen"
ustates.96.b:0 "Back down for now"

ustates.97.t:0 "CSA Attack the Minutemen"
ustates.97.d:0 "When Garner backed down from Long, it gave Long the excuse to run wild in Missouri. Long denounced the President as being a coward and a do-nothing leader. Reed has gone on record insisting that this spat is a farce, and in reality Garner is working with Long. CSA groups began erecting barricades and armed units have been rising throughout the North."
ustates.97.a:0 "You're both full of it!"

ustates.98.t:0 "The Army and Minutemen Clash"
ustates.98.d:0 "When the Army arrived in St. Louis they were attacked by the Minutemen who refused to comply with the Presidential decree. The exchanges lasted for a few days but the army was able to remove the Minutemen. Long denounced the action as being barbaric and Garner doing the work of Reed and the syndicalists."

ustates.150.d:0 "The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been proposed. This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. It is thought that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The question now is will it be ratified or will it fail to be ratified?"

ustates.152.d:0 "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defense, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist PR campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."

ustates.156.d:0 "It is known by most Democrats that economic reform is necessary to preserve American integrity, to this end Democrats differ on the agency the government must take towards existing industries that are ailing. A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land. Conservative Democrats oppose such intrusions as these, saying that it violates states’ rights to govern trade. More liberal-minded Democrats hold fast that the necessity and potential of Public Works outweigh the risks."

It is an examination of the connection between race and idealism and his thesis on the American Creed. Myrdal was funded by the Carnegie Institute and was chosen for his ambivalence towards American politics. Therefore this report carries with it support from many institutions, and Myrdal, as a result, is invited to the White House for dinner.

An important provision in the Fair Deal is the intervention of federal policy to regulate the market and even prevent bank failure. Several high profile Republicans like Robert Taft oppose stretching executive power even if it could benefit the economy. To counter, Quentin Roosevelt has stated the role of the President to ensure the health of the American people extends to their economy."

Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

The gun was aimed at President MacArthur by a madman who, once arrested, claimed MacArthur was building a military junta and must be stopped. The ravings of this loon most interestingly have not been traced back to any political group, and it appears to be a lone wolf attempt on the President's life.

ustates.177.d:0 "President Willkie, despite being a lifelong Democrat, never actively endorsed the Southern Democrat line on race. An early critic of John Nance Garner for failing to appeal to black voters in 1936, Willkie made up for that with a historic speech at the NAACP Convention. Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA. His speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America.

That National Highway system, which President Byrd describes as a "massive waste and an enabler of eminent domain", echoing the Conservative Democratic opposition to any Fair Deal that adds land to the Federal Trust.

As president, Wallace has taken his share in Hi-Bred and instructed the Department of Agriculture to disseminate information about hybrid crops, which are beginning to show improvement in water retention over normal crops.

ustates.180.d:0 "Out of the several strange requests President Taylor has made over the years, this has to be the hardest to handle. President Taylor has convinced several Progressive Congressmen to revive his old legislation promoting World Unity. Explained as a successor to President Wilson's peace plans he spoke of as the Weltkrieg raged on, World Unity is the preservation of human life and culture and the end of total war. This proposal in Congress was of course defeated, but the gesture has surprisingly boosted President Taylor's reputation."

ustates.181.t:0 "Taylor Takes the Stage Nationwide"
ustates.181.d:0 "One of the many eccentric qualities of President Taylor is his singing career. From his time singing to children on the steps of the Capitol building to now singing in front of his millions of constituents. President Taylor has leveraged what would have made him a laughing stock in politics into a genuine expression of his patriotism in art. Taylor sings to promote unity in America over politics, and cooperation instead of victory."

ustates.182.t:0 "Barkley Ends The Corvee System"
ustates.182.d:0 "A division appears between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."

As a cost-cutting measure, Russell authorized the use of penal labour to undertake constructions for the state. This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!'. This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this. Rumours of Hollywood planning a movie on this book have also circulated."

Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming.

### Military stuff ###

ustates.300.t:0 "Military Research"
ustates.300.d:0 "We are having our best scientists and business leaders look into what we should invest our efforts into guns, artillery, tanks, our improving our own doctrines. What should we choose?"
ustates.300.a:0 "Modernize our Guns"
ustates.300.b:0 "Modernize our Artillery"
ustates.300.c:0 "Modernize our Tanks"
ustates.300.e:0 "Modernize our Doctrines"

ustates.301.t:0 "Full Utilization of Force"
ustates.301.d:0 "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."
ustates.301.a:0 "Lawrence Bell's Jet"
ustates.301.b:0 "Oppenheimer's Atom Bomb"
ustates.301.c:0 "Authorize more funds for both"

ustates.302.t:0 "Albuquerque Project"
ustates.302.d:0 "Bell's X project has proceeded satisfactorily, with a successful implementation of rocket technology into planes being able to double the speed of older aircraft. Brave test pilot Jack Woolams today was the first person to fly the plane faster than 741 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier."
ustates.302.a:0 "Prepared for even Interplanetary War"

ustates.303.t:0 "Winchester Project"
ustates.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
ustates.303.a:0 "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy"

ustates.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more"

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
ustates.305.a:0 "We appreciate your support"

ustates.306.t:0 "The new normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
ustates.306.a:0 "Let freedom ring"
ustates.306.b:0 "Let the cannons roar"

ustates.307.t:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
ustates.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."
ustates.307.a:0 "The Air Force belongs to the Army"
ustates.307.b:0 "The Air Force belongs to the Navy"
ustates.307.c:0 "The Air Force Belongs to itself"

ustates.308.t:0 "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."
ustates.308.a:0 "Goddard's Rocket"
ustates.308.b:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb"
ustates.308.c:0 "Reich's Bomb"

ustates.309.t:0 "Goddard's Successful Launch"
ustates.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
ustates.309.a:0 "Good boy Goddard"

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
ustates.311.a:0 "Not our proudest moment."
