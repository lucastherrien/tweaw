### Events ###

### Intro Events ###

swe.9999.t:0 "What happened to the Swedish focus tree?"
swe.9999.d:0 "Once we began reworking the Nordic nations we realised that the old Swedish focus tree wasn't compatible with the newer trees. Rather than delay the whole rework until they were all finished, we decided to remove Swedens old focus tree (well, most of it). We are sorry about taking this step backwards, but it has let development in the area move quicker. We are working on a new Swedish tree, we won't be leaving them like this forever."
swe.9999.a:0 "That's a shame, but I understand."

### 1936 Events ###

swe.3.t:0 "Sweden hit by Black Monday"
swe.3.d:0 "When the German market collapsed a few days ago Sweden felt the waves come crashing. Initially there was a small blow but it seemed to stabilise quickly enough... And then it all came crashing down too. After the Weltkrieg Sweden became heavily dependent on Swedish-German trade, either directly with Germany or with their puppet states among the Baltic sea. We'll have to perform several industrial reforms to recover from this!"
swe.3.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

### Elections ###

### Focus Tree Events ###
swe.500.t:0 "The Air Force Summit"
swe.500.d:0 "The Swedish economy is unable to fulfil the demands recently presented by the navy and air force. The navy is large, but most of the ships are old and in need of replacement. Building a modern fleet to dominate the Baltic would require a huge investment. At the same time, the Swedish air force has presented plans for drastically expanding the service. Sweden could have a huge fleet of modern combat aircraft. But such an investment would require neglecting the Swedish navy. The two services hope to solve convince the government of the merit of their respective arguments."
swe.500.a:0 "We need to decide wisely..."

swe.501.t:0 "The Naval Plan"
swe.501.d:0 "The Swedish Navy has presented its plan for future development. The Naval Board wishes to build new armoured ships, in addition to modern escorts and submarines. The goal is threefold. The navy must be able to protect Sweden's long coast, control the Baltic Sea and project power. Although it has only been suggested, it is clear that marine management is thinking of Åland, Finland and the Baltics."
swe.501.a:0 "Promise more funding"
swe.501.b:0 "The navy won't be prioritised"

swe.502.t:0 "The Air Force Plan"
swe.502.d:0 "The Swedish air force has protested regarding our promise to support the navy plan. They claim that modern aircraft can destroy both enemy armies and ships. A large air force would therefore be more flexible and efficient than the navy."
swe.502.a:0 "Promise them funding as well"
swe.502.b:0 "The air force won't be prioritised"

swe.503.t:0 "The Air Force Plan"
swe.503.d:0 "The Swedish air force has proposed drastically expanding the service. Sweden could have a large air force consisting of modern, indigenous designs."
swe.503.a:0 "Promise more funding"
swe.503.b:0 "The air force won't be prioritised"

swe.504.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.504.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and the navy has successfully convinced the government to prioritize naval construction."
swe.504.a:0 "A strong navy for the future"

swe.505.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.505.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and the air force has successfully convinced the government to prioritize the acquisition of new planes."
swe.505.a:0 "A strong air force for the future"

swe.506.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.506.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and neither branch has been able to successfully convince the government to prioritize military funding. It is clear that the Swedish economy cannot support the development of both a modern navy and a modern air force. Both military leaders and ministers have demanded that the government makes a decision. Which service should recieve priority in the future?"
swe.506.a:0 "We need a strong navy"
swe.506.b:0 "We need a modern air force"
