allgost.3.b:0 "NO! We cannot let this happen! Buy them now!"
allgost.4.t:0 "The Reactionary Reforms"
allgost.4.d:0 "With the Burning of the Head-Office, the Board realised a change in policy is required to improve its fiscal outlook and keep Nationalist sentiments in Southern and Central China under control.

The result of the meeting is..."

Almost overnight, fully one third of Southern China's workforce was unemployed. A large majority of these people became migratory workers, moving from job to job in great masses. There have been attempts to unionise in the more urbanised areas, and the Unionists were made an example of."

The only region where there have been no reported riots is the coastline as the fishing and shipping industries remain unaffected."
