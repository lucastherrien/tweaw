### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1936"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, lasting until 1860 when Sardinia sought to unite Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoies who did not care much for actually industrialising the south and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began in 1914 Italy chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. When the Austrians achieved victory against the Italians, they broke up the Kingdom into a number of smaller states, and out of the resulting bloody civil war the Kingdom of The Two Sicilies was reborn.\n\nSince the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been focused internally, trying to resolve the serious issues left by the House of Savoy, and the politically successful Social Democrats have tried to carve out a new path for the Kingdom. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Ddoje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics.\n\nOnly time will tell if they get to achieve this or if democracy will prevail."
sic.1.a:0 "Long live the King!"

sic.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
sic.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
sic.2.a:0 "May God protect us!"

sic.3.t:0 "Poverty and Crime Rises"
sic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, it has caused poverty to skyrocket and the living standards of many Sicilians to drop. At the same time, the various criminal cartels have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased out in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something."
sic.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t:0 "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d:0 "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo and everything in between. Supposedly lead by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left wing. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them"

sic.5.t:0 "A call for Traditional Values"
sic.5.d:0 "The conservative Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon calling for a return to traditional values and to turn away from Social Democratic policies that are ruining the kingdom and the fault for Black Monday. Many that support the Social Conservative Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
sic.5.a:0 "May God protect the kingdom"

sic.6.t:0 "Fighting between the Left and Right"
sic.6.d:0 "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labor' for the ruling Partito Cristiano Democratico was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
sic.6.a:0 "The Union members are innocent"
sic.6.b:0 "They are disloyal traitors."

sic.7.t:0 "The Liberal Coalition"
sic.7.d:0 "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Democrats and the Social Conservatives. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Democratic party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Cristiano Democratico. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."

However, such a move seems to many as not dissimilar to syndicalism. Thus a more moderate form has been proposed as a counter by the Partito Popolare Demoractico, which has some attraction even among some of the conservatives.
