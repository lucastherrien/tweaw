### Huey Long Path ###
TEX_new_washington:0 "The New Washington"
TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "The new American seat of government will throw off the old shackles of Capitoline tradition and rebuild itself as a defensible and secure location for the three branches to seat power. Boulevards are now too wide for barricades, structures are now supplied with emergency power, and shelters are guaranteed for residents."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Following the trail of convicted traitors, President Huey has found a group of Congressmen that were in contact with business executives planning against us. Although they are now behind bars, some have eluded capture through political avenues. We are investigating whether the captured Richard Butler in his asylum will lead us to any more traitors."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore, therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."
TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm.

TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation is being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to poison the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. Huey Long is however incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is Huey's promise America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy as Huey Long describes it is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of his home state of Louisiana, Huey Long has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission. The Peoples Commission is a nonpartisan forum for public discussion that will allow the AFP to directly communicate with the American people and hear issues that politicians will not report on."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. It is positive thinking and the end of pessimistic greed that caused the Great Depression that will save America. Following Huey Long's economic and social plans to transform America and rewrite the political landscape."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now Huey Long has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education.

TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses Huey Long has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself.

TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well.

A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual income. Incomes are capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls show an overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, Huey Long has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives.

TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect Democracy"
TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The original Constitution set out to create the perfect union in America. This union failed, America died, but through President Long it was saved. Huey Long and the American people have agreed that the Constitution is now a document to build a more perfect democracy. The uninterrupted will of the American peoples as exerted by its leaders."
### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
TEX_the_business_plot:0 "The Business Plot"
TEX_the_business_plot_desc:0 "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The reborn American Republic will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
TEX_use_the_fbi:0 "Use the FBI"
TEX_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against syndicalists. Cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. We can trust the FBI to look in all the wrong places for Huey Long. If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
TEX_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
TEX_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organizations with known syndicalist members. These groups will be monitored under the new COINTELPRO program, a the first fully empowered counterintelligence program capable of monitoring communications between group members."
TEX_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
TEX_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favor through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
TEX_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
TEX_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
TEX_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
TEX_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomized by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for the American Republic to replant American Nationalism."
TEX_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
TEX_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of Huey Long would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that convinced Huey Long's Minutemen bodyguards to take that necessary detour."
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "Control the Boy Scouts"
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organizations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the American Republic to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorizes the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
TEX_fordism:0 "Fordism"
TEX_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."
TEX_american_capitalism1:0 "American Capitalism"
TEX_american_capitalism1_desc:0 "The American Republic is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalize the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
TEX_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
TEX_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
TEX_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
TEX_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
TEX_industrial_security_act:0 "Industrial Security Act"
TEX_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorize the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
TEX_pass_nira:0 "National Labor Relations Act"
TEX_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labor crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by Moseley to set up a national labor relations bureau. The NLRB will remedy unfair labor practices by both unions and business owners. The impartial wording of the agency has received widespread support from third parties."
TEX_red_scare:0 "Red Scare"
TEX_red_scare_desc:0 "The FBI has announced that after many months of searching for President Long, he can no longer be presumed alive. The uproar against any socialist groups remaining in America is enormous. The War Powers Committee can barely keep up with all the state laws being passed to stop socialism. Public approval for Moseley is at an all-time high."
TEX_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
TEX_traditional_values_desc:0 "An address by President Moseley has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature. The press is divided between those that know Moseley as an antisemitic canard and those who truly believe in the American Republic. Nevertheless, the public loves it."
TEX_republic_without_democracy:0 "Republic without Democracy"
TEX_republic_without_democracy_desc:0 "The American public is now in agreement that Huey Long's true vision of America was that of a Republic without Democracy. Moseley's term has been extended for another four years due to the continued emergency that threatens the American continent. Americanism as the War Powers Committee sees it grows as the term oligarchy loses its stigma."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory:0 "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"
TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory_desc:0 "It took many Americans by surprise to hear Huey Long's confession of being a syndicalist broadcast that night. The initial backlash could have ended the brief revolution had the Silver Legion faltered. Thankfully, the American Legion and Prohibition Party had deserted Long after his betrayal of his promises. This is the beginning of a new America."
TEX_the_silver_legion:0 "The Silver Legion"
TEX_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion is currently the unofficial head of the American Legion, with propaganda delivered slowly through agents. This has led to pockets of dissent in some American Legion outposts. We must identify these dissidents and redistribute them to far flung outposts in order to minimize their potential."
TEX_absorb_the_klan:0 "Absorb the Klan"
TEX_absorb_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans has been officially inducted into the Silver Legion at a mass Klan gathering in the capital today. His word carries weight in the KKK and will be essential to reel in the Klan. We will also require that Klansmen no longer conceal their faces. In order to use the influence of members to the fullest extent."
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors:0 "Crackdown on Traitors"
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors_desc:0 "A group of stubborn Klansman that refuse to reveal their names have come to Pelley seeking exception. Our Chief Pelley made an enlightened decision to this issue, and has sent the Klansmen into a Secret Service. With a portion of the Klan still undercover, we will be able to seek out and eliminate those with reservations against us."
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm:0 "The Covenant, Sword, and Arm"
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm_desc:0 "Members of the Silver Legion in the White Identity Church of Jesus Christ-Christian have reported that many local financial institutions in their area are controlled by syndicalists and foreigners. Since the Legion is overstretched, our Chief Pelley has authorized the Church to appropriate wealth from citizens whether willing or not."
TEX_camps_for_syndies:0 "Criminalise Syndicalism"
TEX_camps_for_syndies_desc:0 "The future of Syndicalism and Longism has been decided. Labor re-education and internment camps are authorized by the shell Congress to house suspected syndicalists indefinitely until the national emergency of the Civil War has truly ended. The American Legion has already begun to clear meeting houses and city councils of traitors."
TEX_forced_labor:0 "Forced Labor"
TEX_forced_labor_desc:0 "The loss of one hundred thousand people from the labor market has angered what used to be loyal Legionaries. Debates in the once quiet halls of Congress are erupting to demand Pelley find a solution to the lack of able-bodied workers in America. Pelley's solution? Forced labor for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."
TEX_jim_crows_america:0 "Jim Crows America"
TEX_jim_crows_america_desc:0 "The way of life in the South that the northerner Pelley found, that of segregation and state laws that prevented blacks from exercising civil rights, struck Pelley as the true soul of America. Finally, with total control and the world to gain by acting, Pelley has begun to suggest northern states pass Jim Crow laws of their own."
TEX_protecting_our_race:0 "Revive Nativism"
TEX_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as Pelley and Armstrong see it are connected not only to the former nation of Britain, but to Anglo Saxons as a race. An executive act by Pelley has illegalized inter-racial marriage, requiring all marriages to occur in Christian Identity churches, and the Silver Legion itself has been deployed to re-segregate schools."
TEX_segregation_forever:0 "Segregation Forever"
TEX_segregation_forever_desc:0 "Our inability to stop protesters from returning each day despite the beatings and the bullets proved to be an intriguing challenge. The Silver Legion has decided to employ an overwhelming alliance to out-shout the dissidents by calling up segregationist organizations in the South and inviting them to the Capital."
TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "Pelley's grand vision of the American Commonwealth is a country free of debt and bonds by turning the entire government into a gigantic corporation. Inalienable rights are given, not promised to native born Americans in the form of stocks that pay annual dividend or 'credits' to citizens that vote on their Silver Legion representative."
TEX_white_welfare:0 "Common-wealth For Citizens"
TEX_white_welfare_desc:0 "First order is to determine who is a true natural citizen and deserving of stock in the Common-wealth. They must be able to trace their ancestry to original voters at the time of the American Revolution, or have sworn a new oath the Silver Legion has prepared to dedicate their lives and they dynasty to Christians Identity forever."
TEX_christian_education:0 "Christian Education"
TEX_christian_education_desc:0 "Harvard's Divinity School should have been the gold standard for education since its inception. The education of Christians is essential to the Silver Legion's long life, and to do that we should fund divinity schools across the nation in the Harvard Model. Introspection into the secrets of Christianity will stop syndicalist thought."
TEX_christian_identity:0 "Christian Identity"
TEX_christian_identity_desc:0 "What began as an offshoot of Anglo-Israelism in Canada has grown into a concrete political and social doctrine under the Pelley-Armstrong line. Christian Identity envisions a union of German-Assyrians, Afro-Americans, Socialists, Jewish people, and Catholics that are all in a confederation against them. Now the public shall know of this danger."
TEX_church_and_state:0 "Church and State"
TEX_church_and_state_desc:0 "There are implicit religious values within America that only the Silver Legion can see. It is obvious to the Silver Legion and the Pelley-Armstrong line that America was meant to be ruled by only pious Protestant Christians. Therefore, Chief Pelley has recognized Christianity as the official religion of the American Commonwealth."
TEX_christian_service_brigade:0 "Christian Service Brigade"
TEX_christian_service_brigade_desc:0 "What began as a volunteer organization for young boys during the Civil War has now become a nationally funded organization, The Christian Service Brigade.

TEX_citzens_council:0 "White Citizens Council"
TEX_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council. The White Citizens Council has taken up the torch to intimidate voters and discourage citizen stockholders meetings from pushing for integration. Pelley has subtlety increased the common share of the White Citizens Council in response."
TEX_christian_work_ethic:0 "Christian Work Ethic"
TEX_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of the Commonwealth, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Silver Legion did not intend. Blue Laws that used to allow Christian time off of work to go to church are being revoked as by those who do not value the morals of the nation. We must bring Blue Laws back."
TEX_america_is_born_again:0 "America is Born Again"
TEX_america_is_born_again_desc:0 "Many doubted the ability for the Silver Legion to succeed Huey Long, but those that took the risk are now enjoying the fruits of America's credit system and renewed faith. Huey Long's legacy is that of blindness and deception that gave way to Pelley's truth. What remains to be seen is what the foreign conspirators will do next."
### Reconstruction ###
TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist and Syndicalist forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained.

TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasizes the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work.

TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it makes a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "Civil Works Administration"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to fighting and the poverty of the disorganized Federalists.

TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Security Administration"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core power of the South.

TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "A long list of former Federalist and Syndicalist buildings have been composed with priority placed on cultural heritage and defensibility. Should utility override past grievances? Is the potential for sabotage by these companies great? We must decide."
TEX_harsh_reconstruction:0 "Punish the Corrupt and Treacherous"
TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc:0 "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people.

TEX_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
TEX_reconciliation_desc:0 "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies.

TEX_coprotate_militarism:0 "Corporate Alliance"
TEX_coprotate_militarism_desc:0 "The old bureaucratic system of time-based seniority pales in comparison to scientific management as proposed by Fredrick Taylor. We need the expertise of business professionals within Congress, in order to secure an alliance with the corporate infrastructure in America."
TEX_business_subsides:0 "Loosen Regulations"
TEX_business_subsides_desc:0 "The dual-layered federal government system had allowed for at times very loose regulations on workspace practice, depending on the state. In order to leverage this inherent balance in our government, we must allow businesses both large and small to thrive."
TEX_building_grants:0 "Building Grants"
TEX_building_grants_desc:0 "Smaller townships across America have no recourse if their need is slightly less than the threshold for contract work. Our remedy is a Building Grant program based off of the Ford Foundation. This allows communities to show proper need and return on investment for contract work."
TEX_banking_act:0 "Corporate Militarism"
TEX_banking_act_desc:0 "Many businesses closed or were temporarily forced to leave America when union activity reached a pitched frenzy.

TEX_military_factories:0 "Military Factories"
TEX_military_factories_desc:0 "Munitions factories and armories are reporting a large loss of stock to theft as well as difficulty competing with foreign competition. We can fix the first without infringing on the Second Amendment with a tariff on imported arms."
TEX_american_business_is_business:0 "American Business is Business"
TEX_american_business_is_business_desc:0 "As most of Congress is fiscally conservative, it was easy to pass laws reorganizing the newly named National Reserve to stop deflation. We must lower the money supply and remove illegal currency from circulation or else our buying power will never recover."
TEX_create_esmwt:0 "Research Investments"
TEX_create_esmwt_desc:0 "As we revitalize research labs and think tanks across the nation, we have also begun to spread highly rewarding research grants that have laid dormant during the Civil War.

TEX_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy.

### Army Path ###
TEX_fight_for_america:0 "Fight for America"
TEX_fight_for_america_desc:0 "Seizing the military installations of our allied Generals won't be enough to prevent MacArthur's War. A War Plan must be rapidly drawn up and executed in the event of both a short and protracted war."

TEX_military_industry:0 "Military Industry"
TEX_military_industry_desc:0 "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies.

TEX_new_army_doctrines:0 "New Army Doctrines"
TEX_new_army_doctrines_desc:0 "A meeting of our ramshackle Chief of Staff and Generals have decided upon a course of wartime research. Although it will be expensive to devise and test new battle plans while we are already at war, the greatest struggle demands the strongest wills."

TEX_we_can_do_it:0 "We Can Do It"
TEX_we_can_do_it_desc:0 "Positivism is one tool of motivation Huey Long has taught us. Several of our harsher generals have reluctantly allowed positivist pamphlets and entertainment into the barracks. Decades of derision in American soldiers melts away when told that every soldier can be a hero."
TEX_trained_officers:0 "Trained Officers"
TEX_trained_officers_desc:0 "We have made the bold decision to train Officers in the hostile swampland of Parris Island. Classrooms may not be as well-equipped as West Point, but our officers will receive an education in hard knocks that will prove America's worth more than its refinement."
TEX_new_training:0 "New Weapons"
TEX_new_training_desc:0 "Our storage of prototype firearms from the 1919 trials have been recovered and are being generously donated to manufacturers. We must be able to at least match designs with that the Federal Army has already considered in the past."

TEX_auto_industry_desc:0 "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up with earnest by the people of America.

TEX_shock_and_awe:0 "Shock and Awe"
TEX_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Trench warfare on the American continent can be brutal. We know from experience that fighting in Appalachia is biased towards the defender. Despite our better nature, we must employ the heaviest artillery shells in order to force our enemies to retreat."

TEX_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"
TEX_war_bonds_desc:0 "Funding the war effort will require more than victory gardens and volunteer-ism. Liquid assets are in short supply, especially with our economic programs ongoing. We can capitalize on public trust and implement War Bonds as most other free nations do."
TEX_increased_weapons_production:0 "Increased Weapons Production"

TEX_rouse_the_people:0 "Rouse the People"
TEX_rouse_the_people_desc:0 "Recruitment is plateaued due to a limit on how far our propaganda covers. Depicting only white solders and white male auxiliaries in ease is deceptive. Perhaps a more realistic depiction of military life will bring forth truer enthusiasm?"
TEX_army_bonus_bill:0 "Army Bonus Bill"
TEX_army_bonus_bill_desc:0 "Combat hardens boys into men and men into solid steel - unshakeable pillars of Americanism. Only a fool would leave veterans such as these by the wayside.

unionstate.1.t:0 "The American Legion Appointment"
unionstate.1.d:0 "With the end of the civil war comes a vacancy in the ever important position of the American Legion's National Commander. This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the Syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. The most common name floated up is General George Moseley, though his antisemitism does dissuade some from his nomination. Huey Long also believes that his friend and ally Fox Connor whom introduced Patton to Huey's cause should have the position. Pelley's name has also been placed onto our desk several times despite the door being locked. Who shall be appointed?"

It seems that the War Powers Committee have been looking to the American Legion to try and get support to overthrow him. This news first makes the room fall silent and then anger from Long who orders the arrest of all the traitors to America. The gang, now known as the Business Plot, is due to appear at trial shortly."

unionstate.3.d:0 "A rapid fire session of Congress under Huey Long has been able to pass several enabling acts thus far. Exhausted by dictating President Long's orders, allies within the Prohibition Party and old Democrats have come today to deliver a more radical proposal for their constituents. Barrel-rolled together is a bill for veteran back pay, and a proposal for the Prohibition Amendment. Prohibition is popular with conservative protestants in the South, but is seen as tyrannical by the so-called Wet States in the North and West. Unfortunately, the big tent politics of the AFP mean these bills can only pass together or not at all. The final decision lies with Huey Long."

The disappearance was not noted until nine the next morning, and by then the newspapers had already begun spinning a story about Syndicalist plotters. The Secret Service, having been decimated by the war, must seek the aid of the FBI if they are to ever find President Long alive. American Legion national commander George Van Horn Moseley has announced that he will guide the country until a proper leader is found, making sure that syndicalism is uprooted from the country. Congress has called an emergency session to deal with succession, as kidnapping has no proper recourse in the Constitution."

An armed march occurred that night towards the Presidential Mansion, with open intention to kill President Long. Thankfully Pelley had underestimated the support Huey had from the people of the Capital city, and a firefight had broken out in front of the Second Civil War Memorial. Pelley's men folded quickly to reinforcing Minutemen, some of whom recognized Silver Legion traitors as their old comrades. By morning's dawn, surviving Silver Legion traitors were arrested and Pelley himself sent to an insane asylum after being deemed mentally unfit to stand trial."

Among his conspirators are now close confidants of President Long, who had deserted Long after he vetoed Prohibition and the Veterans bill. These new traitors provided the crucial passes to get past Minutemen security and allowed the Silver Legion execute a coup. A cadre of Silver Legion assassins swooped into the Presidential Mansion and seized Huey Long. After a brief mock trial where he is found guilty of tyranny and attempting to infiltrate syndicalism into America, Huey Long is shot that very night. William Dudley Pelley has announced to a cautious and guarded crowd that he will guide the country making sure that syndicalism is rooted out of the country.

unionstate.11.d:0 "The years of service to America has worn Father Charles Coughlin down. In between his radio shows, Social Justice publications, he rarely has time to promote Share Our Wealth Societies. This coupled with his increasing emotional instability has led to this day. President Long, while silent on this issue, sympathizes with the Jewish citizens for whom Coughlin has made their lives very difficult. We must retire Coughlin, but who should replace him? The calmer preacher Billy Graham? Huey's old running mate William Lemke? Or up-and-coming Longist Rush Holt Sr.?"

This is why today's newspaper shocked Huey Long so greatly. An expose' found Hugo Black's Klan membership. Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama. While Black's judicial record does paint him as a liberal, this flies directly in the face of Long's anti-Klan campaign. Should we fire Hugo Black?"

These new employees were directed by Marine Veteran Sidney McMath, and were paid on the federal payroll. Now there exists a tension between the old and the new in Share Our Wealth. Old guard leader Francis Townsend advocates for Share Our Wealth to remain a non-governmental entity to prevent partisan politics, while McMath wishes to officiate it as a Federal Department."

The book a science fiction about a scientist that invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The science fiction with the revelation that all the characters both white and black are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that Huey Long enjoys the book."

unionstate.31.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
unionstate.31.d:0 "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. It's mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a Syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
unionstate.31.a:0 "We'll film their trials"

unionstate.32.t:0 "Persistence of Antisemitism"
unionstate.32.d:0 "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's aging logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other Committee members, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including Moseley still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilize the new America's international relations."

unionstate.32.b:0 "Side with The Committee"

unionstate.33.t:0 "Tying up Loose Ends"
unionstate.33.d:0 "Weaving spiders are the many members of the press that continue the fruitless search for Huey Long. Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press that do not believe that Syndicalists did the deed. While most pamphlets on this are published anonymously, the FBI have traced their origin, and surprisingly found them to be coming from both the left and right politically. These conspiracy theorists as we call them could destabilize our new government if they continue their publications."
unionstate.33.a:0 "Censor them!"

unionstate.34.t:0 "Every Girl a Queen?"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears that Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington demanding that Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist that Huey Long's running mate William Lemke is the constitutionally correct President. As the War Powers Committee, we must ensure that neither party gains the upper hand too soon. Let us tip the scales into balance so that no decision will be made."

unionstate.35.t:0 "But No One Wears A Crown"
unionstate.35.d:0 "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready. Exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President to then serve as President until Huey is found. this involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."

unionstate.36.t:0 "Twenty Second Amendment"
unionstate.36.d:0 "The Committee is in agreement on the future of the 17th Amendment, the amendment that forced direct election on senators.

unionstate.37.t:0 "Patriotism or Profits"
unionstate.37.d:0 "A conflict of interests has arisen between the market and the War Powers Committee. A recent speech given by Roger Babson highlighted the hypocrisy of multinational corporations that both claim to be patriotic while also opening factories in syndicalist nations in Europe. Our own Fred Koch fired back by stating that the market and American people want their businesses to succeed as an extension of patriotism. While the War Powers Committee leads several multinational corporations, we have noticed a strong uptick in domestic sales that could remove the risk of retreating from foreign markets. It is time for the Committee to settle this national debate."
unionstate.37.a:0 "Business is our Business"
unionstate.37.b:0 "Patriotism is our Business"

unionstate.38.t:0 "The Second American Plan"
unionstate.38.d:0 "Although the syndicalists are defeated and their members have gone to ground, there still remains the threat of union growth Huey Long foolishly promised. A proposal from Congress may be able to remedy this. The original American Plan was legislation proposed during the Wilson administration to guarantee employers ability to challenge Union activities. The foolish Congress under McAdoo failed to properly ensure this right, but the new American Republic will correct that. The American Plan will allow individual states to pass right-to-work laws and authorizes the federal courts to prosecute union activity violating those laws."

The fear that the political spotlight the War Powers Committee is in by holding Cabinet positions has two possible solutions. The first is to coordinate with Congress to push through a law to reorganize the Presidential Cabinet to officially become the War Powers Committee. The second is to appoint several of our loyalist politicians from Congress to appease prying eyes and keep the stability our new American Republic needs. Either way, our executive power is still secure."

Initial assurances of civil protection by Huey Long kept many from the streets as socialists and federalists roiled. There were even planned meetings in New York City for Huey Long to directly address civil rights concerns before that fateful day. Now with Huey Long gone, all illusions of safety are dead. Walter Francis White, along with several high ranking members of the NAACP, have declared the new America illegitimate.

The Mothers Movements are a group of religiously minded conservative women that aligned with the radical elements that sought to undermine Huey Long. Now that Huey is long gone, leaders like Alma Bridwell White and Elizabeth Dilling now direct hysteria against suspected socialists. Their marches have also demonstrated a xenophobia against Catholics and blacks as well.

unionstate.51.d:0 "It began in the Meeting Halls of the Silver Legion, the idea that vaccines were a Syndicalist plot to poison America. This coupled with a belief that America's public water has been poisoned by fluoride and the dangers of sanitariums has propelled many a new politician into office. None higher than former Congressman Clare Hoffman, who has gained a following within the Silver Legion. This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's polio vaccine research, which we could really have used. Now the summer heat has brought with it the largest Polio outbreak in American history.

In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a Syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch as it is called now has the ability to become fully operational.

To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend, he is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one in the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well accepted in this brave new American society, should we go open with some of his more.....esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers as it is can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"

One group out in California called Mankind United claims that America's savior is thier local minister. Another has insinuated that we are willing to assist the Catholic nations in liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds insurance. The Silver Legion leadership is divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous or not enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"

The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation.

unionstate.56.t:0 "Second only to The Chief"
unionstate.56.d:0 "Our Chief Pelley was surprised when the Roman Catholic Charles Coughlin came into the Silver Legion offices to offer his service to The Commonwealth. His position has been tenuous since then, as our former Klansmen continue to monitor the publication of Social Justice. Today however is different, now that his radio show's time slot has been taken by more important public services. His position as Chief Propagandist is effectively open. To whom should the post go to? To the very useful Herbert W Armstrong? To the loyal Richard Butler? or to an old American Firster Gerald L.K. Smith, whom has shown interest in turning Social Justice in to a real Christian publication."

unionstate.57.t:0 "Officiate Warren G. Harding as Black"
unionstate.57.d:0 "The official records in the United States has always been biased in favor of the ruling party. Once in office, Thomas Jefferson slandered the memory of the great patriot John Adams and fooled subsequent generations into believing that his love for Nativism was tyranny. Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio Warren G. Harding to hide his black ancestry. We have the papers to prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harding's father was a black man and therefore complicit in a worldwide conspiracy against the Commonwealth."

unionstate.58.t:0 "The Sound and the Fury in theaters"
unionstate.58.d:0 "Today famed author William Faulkner's seminal work The Sound and The Fury releases in theaters to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son Jason. In the film Jason sacrifices his hard earned wealth to save his brother Benjy from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honor by sending his brother Quentin away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece Miss Quentin defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents."
unionstate.58.a:0 "I wrote better films than this!"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Black Education Act"
unionstate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Pelley in order to solidify Christian Identity into the America youth is nearly complete. his final act which passed with unanimous approval by the shell of Congress is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and in particular African-Americans. Notably it focused the education of African-Americans for their role as labors and distances themselves from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, he famously stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice?'."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Education that suits them"

unionstate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
unionstate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Pelley is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper the Silver Legion claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous common-wealth to African-Americans nationwide. However, there comes even from our loyal members murmurs that a whites within the Black Belt would also lose their rights. What shall become of this act?"

unionstate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
unionstate.61.d:0 "The Silver Legion has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Silver Legion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended their claims with violence. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Commonwealth."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Papers Please"

unionstate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
unionstate.62.d:0 "The Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country. However, the Amendment allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. A new order passed by the shell Congress has increased the sentence time for moral crimes and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labor has been given boost by reviving various Black Codes that criminalize attempting to vote as an African-American. The boisterous speeches Pelley delivers on the radio have tried to obfuscate the unfolding truth that slavery is back."
unionstate.62.a:0 "Do your time"

unionstate.63.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing Pelley's terror. Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate the masses of people struggling to remain free. To the Silver Legion and their leaders, this plays into a longstanding fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is what shall we do. Shall we let them leave or shall we keep them here?"
unionstate.63.a:0 "America is expelling toxins"
unionstate.63.b:0 "Quick, Stop Them!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "American Refugees arrive"
unionstate.64.d.psa:0 "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled across the Rockies fleeing Pelley's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more then a few are ready and willing to fight against Pelley."
unionstate.64.d.new_england:0 "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled into New England fleeing Pelley's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more then a few are ready and willing to fight against Pelley."
unionstate.64.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
unionstate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Pelley is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
unionstate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Pelley should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
unionstate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
unionstate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of that monster Pelley. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."
unionstate.64.a:0 "You are welcome to stay"
unionstate.64.b:0 "We do not want you"

unionstate.65.t:0 "Chief Pelley Dies, Gerald Smith Declared Chief"
unionstate.65.d:0 "Church bells around the country rang out today announcing the loss of Chief William Pelley to stress. Many of those bells were ringing in the ghettoes and reservations by the starving Americans hoping that Pelley's death would bring relief. These hopeful millions were scorned when the Vice Chief Gerald L.K. Smith announced at the funeral that he would serve as Chief in Pelley's stead until his Judgement Day. Despite this show of strength, American expats around the world cheer for the dictator's death and have pressed for condemnation of Chief Smith's continued Silver Legion regime in America."

### Military Research ###

unionstate.101.t:0 "The Future of Warfare"
unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilization of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"

In a fenced off area outside White Sands, New Mexico, Goddard's rocket stands ready. The rocket's design incorporates liquid fuel and stabilizers devised by Goddard with flight mechanics devised by Lindbergh Aircraft. At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."

Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested.
