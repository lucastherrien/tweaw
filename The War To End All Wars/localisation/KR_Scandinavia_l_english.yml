The Conservative Party is promising to cut taxes and increase military spending. They are also in favour of maintaining the current status of the federation.

These lands were taken from Denmark in 1864, an event that also marked the end of Scandinavism as a political movement for seventy years. Northern Schleswig, which is mainly populated by Danes, has already sent a delegation to Copenhagen, requesting to join our country. The question is what to do with the rest of the state. Since it contains a clear German majority, an annexation is out of the question. The idea of restoring the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein under a Danish prince might be the best solution."
scandinavia.110.a:0 "Restore the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein"
scandinavia.110.b:0 "Continue with Military Occupation"
