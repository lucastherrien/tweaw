### Events ###
ice.1.t:0 "Fuel Shortage"
ice.1.d:0 "The recent economic downtown has severely diminished the ability of our government and private companies to secure fuel shipments. The fishing industry, which is one of the largest economic sectors in Iceland, is facing collapse as a result"
ice.1.a:0 "Blast! No money!"
ice.2.t:0 "Deal with Iceland"
ice.2.d:0 "The Icelandic economy has suffered economic recently. As a result, A massive fuel shortage looms over Iceland, and threatens to destroy its fishing industry. We can offer them fuel in exchange in exchange for their recognition of our exclusive right to fish off off the coast of Greenland. Perhaps this could also be the beginning of a long and beneficial relationship."
ice.2.a:0 "Approach Iceland with an offer!"
ice.2.b:0 "This does not concern us."
ice.3.t:0 "Canadian Fuel for Rights"
ice.3.d:0 "The Canadians have approached us with an offer of fuel to alleviate our economic woes. In exchange, they have asked for concessions in fishing rights off the coast of Greenland. If we accept this deal, we may avoid a potential crisis."
ice.3.a:0 "Accept the deal!"
ice.3.b:0 "The price is too high."
ice.4.t:0 "Iceland Accepts"
ice.4.d:0 "Iceland has accepted our fuel deal. Our fishing boats now have uninhibited access to Greenland, and Iceland's fuel shortage will soon pass. Perhaps we can exploit this co-operation in later dealings with Iceland."
ice.4.a:0 "Great News!"
ice.5.t:0 "Iceland Refuses"
ice.5.d:0 "Damn those Icelanders! They have refused our offer of fuel in exchange for recognition of our fishing rights around the coast of Greenland. We must another way to extend our influence over their island."
ice.5.a:0 "Too bad."
ice.6.t:0 "Royalists Meddle in Iceland"
ice.6.d:0 "The Royalists are using Iceland's fuel crisis to meddle in the country. This is obviously the beginning of Canadian tampering in Iceland. A Canadian-influenced Iceland could become a base for another foolish attempt to retake British isles. The Republican navy was placed on full alert in response to this threat..."
ice.6.a:0 "We need to keep our eyes on this."
ice.7.t:0 "The Fishermen Protest"
ice.7.d:0 "Fishermen have begun protesting our decision to give up fishing rights off the coast of Greenland, which we were forced to accept through the treaty we signed with Canada. If they would only see reason..."
ice.7.a:0 "Blasted fishermen!"
ice.8.t:0 "Opposition Demands End to Deal"
ice.8.d:0 "The opposition party has demanded we cancel the deal with Canada to address the concerns of fishermen. If we cancel the deal, we will be forced to look elsewhere for fuel, but, if we don't, we will have to face a crisis at home."
ice.8.a:0 "We need that fuel!"
ice.8.b:0 "Cancel the deal"
ice.9.t:0 "Iceland cancels Deal"
ice.9.d:0 "Bowing to pressure at home, the Icelandic government has cancelled its controversial trade deal they had with Canada. This should be most unfortunate for the ambitions the Canadians have with Iceland..."
ice.9.a:0 "Too bad"
ice.10.t:0 "The Reykjavik Riots"
ice.10.d:0 "The refusal of the Icelandic government to cancel its controversial trade deal with Canada has led to large riots in Reykjavik called by opposition parties, socialists and various labour unions. They are demanding an immediate end to the trade deal regarding fishing rights along the coast of Greenland, as well as an end to unwelcome Canadian meddling in Icelandic national affairs."
ice.10.a:0 "Damn those rioters!"
ice.10.b:0 "Interesting."
ice.11.t:0 "Modifying the Deal"
ice.11.d:0 "With all the riots in Reykjavik and our inability to restore order, a suggestion has been made to offer Canada the ability to station troops in Iceland to hopefully restore order. Without it, things could get quite out of hand..."
ice.11.a:0 "Send the request"
ice.11.b:0 "We shall solve this on our own!"
ice.12.t:0 "The Icelandic Request"
ice.12.d:0 "After a series of riots protesting Iceland's deal with us for fuel, the Icelandic government has asked to modify the deal to gain their fishing rights back. In return, they are offering us the ability to station our land, naval, and air forces there. Just what we wanted..."
ice.12.a:0 "Accept their proposition"
ice.12.b:0 "Refuse such a proposal!"
ice.13.t:0 "Canadian Troops in Iceland"
ice.13.d:0 "The Canadian Royalists have used their deal with the government of Iceland to arrange military access to the country. There is no doubt that they will use the island as a base for further incursions against [ENG.GetNameDef]."
ice.13.a:0 "This is unacceptable!"
ice.13.b:0 "Excellent"
ice.13.c:0 "Interesting"
ice.14.t:0 "Blockading Iceland"
ice.14.d:0 "The Royalist incursion in Iceland is unacceptable. If we do not act now, while Canadian control over the island is tenuous and the syndicalist movement in Iceland is still strong, they will solidify their control over island and make it a permanent base for further incursions against us. A blockade is probably the best approach to remove the Royalists and their influence from Iceland."
ice.14.a:0 "Go ahead with the blockade!"
ice.14.b:0 "We are not ready for this"
ice.15.t:0 "Britain blockades Iceland"
ice.15.d:0 "In protest to the changes to the Canadian trade treaty with Iceland, which allowed Canada to station troops on the island, [ENG.GetNameDef] has set up a blockade! Foreign trade ships are being turned back by the British Navy, and tensions are expected to raise between [CAN.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] as a result."
ice.15.aa:0 "This is horrible!"
ice.15.ab:0 "We must respond!"
ice.15.ac:0 "Finally!"
ice.15.ad:0 "Interesting."
ice.16.t:0 "Responding to the Blockade"
ice.16.d:0 "We must respond to this contentious act. The King is demanding war, but the Prime Minister is considering a more subtle approach that will avoid open conflict - at least for the moment. What should we do?"
ice.16.a:0 "War with the bastards!"
ice.16.b:0 "Covert operations will do"
ice.17.t:0 "The Crisis"
ice.17.d:0 "The blockade has caused a crisis in the cabinet and the members of the Popular Unity Party have demanded an election. Fishermen throughout the country have sided with the opposition. What should we do?"
ice.17.a:0 "Hold an election"
ice.17.b:0 "No elections!"
ice.18.t:0 "Opposition walks out"
ice.18.d:0 "After the failure of Iceland's government to call an election, the Popular Unity Party and the Nationalist Party members left the government. Protests are mounting and several armed people have been seen outside of the government buildings."
ice.18.a:0 "This is trouble"
ice.19.t:0 "The People Storm Parliament"
ice.19.d:0 "Members of the Popular Unity Party and the Nationalist Party have agitated crowds in Reykjavik to a near frenzy. The protesters have stormed the government buildings and are barely being kept out of the main assembly hall. Our members of Parliament are convening to the sound of the Revolution."
ice.19.a:0 "Ask Canada for help!"
ice.19.b:0 "We can take care of this!"
ice.20.t:0 "Iceland Asks for Assistance"
ice.20.d:0 "With the violence of the protests, and what could possibly be Union involvement, the Icelandic government has asked us to send in our troops to quell an uprising currently in progress. The King is anxious to support the government, but the Prime Minister would like to avoid an open conflict on the island."
ice.20.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
ice.20.b:0 "Refuse their request"
ice.21.t:0 "Canadian Troops Enter Reykjavik"
ice.21.d:0 "In accordance with an Icelandic request for assistance against a popular uprising, spurred on after a walkout by opposition parties following a refusal by the Icelandic government to hold emergency elections, the government of [CAN.GetNameDef] has sent elements of its armed forces to support the Icelandic government. The move is expected to prompt a response from the [ENG.GetAdjective] government."
ice.21.a:0 "Excellent!"
ice.21.b:0 "We have to do something!"
ice.21.c:0 "Interesting"
ice.22.t:0 "Intervention in Iceland"
ice.22.d:0 "The Icelandic government has requested the Royalists' help in putting down the just cause of the people of Iceland. We must act for the workers."
ice.22.a:0 "Help the workers of Iceland!"
ice.22.b:0 "The workers will triumph without our help"
ice.23.t:0 "No Canadian Intervention"
ice.23.d:0 "The Icelandic government's request for aid from Canada has been denied. The Royalist troops are leaving and the protesters have seized most of Iceland. Most government officials are, together with their Canadian advisers, on board to Ottawa."
ice.23.a:0 "Horrible!"
ice.24.t:0 "Canadians triumph in Reykjavik"
ice.24.d:0 "The Canadian troops sent to Iceland have been able to secure Reykjavik from opposition and protesters. Neither the workers nor the Icelandic government will forget this."
ice.24.a:0 "Back to business!"
ice.24.b:0 "Terrible news!"
ice.24.c:0 "The Syndicalists lose again."
ice.25.t:0 "Protesters Triumph in Reykjavik"
ice.25.d:0 "The alliance between opposition and protesters on Iceland have been able to capture Reykjavik. They are now building a new syndicalist country."
ice.25.a:0 "Time to pack..."
ice.26.t:0 "Canadian and British forces clash"
ice.26.d:0 "Both Canada and Britain have intervened in the ongoing struggle in Reykjavik, meaning that for the first time since the Revolution of 1925 Syndicalist and Royalist units are actively fighting each other. The British are helping the opposition while Canadian forces are supporting government forces. There seems to be a lot of firing and only time will tell who wins this battle."
ice.26.a:0 "Keep your fingers crossed..."
ice.27.t:0 "Canadian Troops Win"
ice.27.d:0 "After a brief skirmish with British forces the Canadian troops have won the day and helped us secure Iceland. A marvelous turn of events."
ice.27.a:0 "Back to business!"
ice.28.t:0 "Royalists Seize Iceland"
ice.28.d:0 "Our forces in Reykjavik have been defeated by the Royalists. They have obviously used some sort of trickery to do this, but the facts are we are out and must respond. Some demand war, others think we should leave."
ice.28.a:0 "Burn them out!"
ice.28.b:0 "Raise the blockade..."
ice.29.t:0 "British Troops win"
ice.29.d:0 "After a brief skirmish with British forces the Canadian troops have been pushed back and the British forces are helping the opposition and protesters secure government buildings. All is lost."
ice.29.a:0 "Pack your bags."
ice.30.t:0 "Canadian Forces Fail"
ice.30.d:0 "The Government of Iceland has been defeated by protesters supported by partisans from [ENG.GetNameDef] despite our continuous support, and are being forced to retreat. We must either avenge this humiliation or helplessly watch as yet another country falls to the Syndicalist scum."
ice.30.a:0 "Burn them out!"
ice.30.b:0 "It is too risky..."
ice.31.t:0 "A New Government for Iceland"
ice.31.d:0 "After successfully intervening in the Icelandic crisis, we are now in a position to install our own type of government. However, there is a conflict in our upper circles: The King believes that we should side with the Icelandic Nationalist Party to ensure that Iceland remains free of socialist influence. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, is hesitant to back an extreme party like that and believes we should not interfere and allow Iceland to remain a democracy."
ice.31.a:0 "The King is right"
ice.31.b:0 "Side with the PM!"
ice.32.t:0 "A New Government for Iceland"
ice.32.d:0 "After successfully intervening in the Icelandic crisis, we are now in a position to install our own type of government. However, there is a conflict in our upper circles: The Maximists believe that we should ensure that Iceland remains free of Royalist influence by using our new influence over Iceland to ensure a Syndicalist government gets into power. The Autonomists, meanwhile, are hesitant to compromise a young democracy in such a fashion and want to let the Icelandic workers elect their own representation."
ice.32.a:0 "Side with the Maximists!"
ice.32.b:0 "The Autonomists are right."
ice.33.t:0 "The Icelandic Election"
ice.33.d:0 "Now that the recent crisis has finally been resolved and peace has been restored, it is time to hold an election to legitimise a new government. This process will obviously be totally democratic and absolutely free."
ice.33.aa:0 "Support the Progressive Party."
ice.33.ab:0 "Side with the Popular Unity Party!"
ice.33.ac:0 "Elect the Independence Party."
ice.33.ad:0 "Hail the Nationalist Party!"
ice.33.ae:0 "The Syndicalists are victorious!"
ice.34.t:0 "The People Take the Government"
ice.34.d:0 "With the help of the workers of Britain, the Popular Unity Party has taken control of Iceland."
ice.34.a:0 "The Glory of the Workers!"
ice.35.t:0 "The new Government"
ice.35.d:0 "The Canadian government has installed the Nationalist Party in Iceland. The strong presence of this party will allow Iceland to hopefully prosper in the face of Socialist agitation."
ice.35.a:0 "Hail the Nationalists!"
