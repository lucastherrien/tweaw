POL_return_galicia_desc:0 "Galicia is rightfully Polish, and we should make a diplomatic request to have the territory returned to our rightful ownership."

POL_absolutism_desc:0 "Poland was weak without a monarch at the helm of the nation. We need to ensure this never happens again, and the power of the monarch must be absolute if Poland is to be great again."
POL_reform_the_monarchy_desc:0 "The nation stands fractured and weak, by reforming the monarchy and reducing the power of the King, we stand to bring the nation into the modern era."
POL_abolish_the_council_desc:0 "The Sejm is a weak and dying institution, and their "elections" only serve to further fracture and divide the people. We need to do away with this relic of the past, and rest all power in the hands of the monarch."
POL_citizens_rights_desc:0 "Drafting a new set of laws to empower the citizens of the nation will result in a more educated, loyal, and productive population."
POL_a_centralized_state_desc:0 "The monarch is the final authority on all matters of state, and the Szlachta only serve to undermine his authority. By undercutting the authority of the nobles, and stalling them at every turn, we stand to reduce their power in the nation and strengthen the King's position."
POL_a_new_sejm_desc:0 "The Sejm has remained unchanged since the nation's resurrection at the end of the Weltkrieg. There are numerous loopholes and inefficiencies that could be rectified by reconstituting the Sejm, and would benefit the nation greatly."

POL_german_tech_sharing_desc:0 "Germany's technological prowess is second to none in Europe. We need to join our technological efforts so that we both may have access to the latest in military technology."

POL_russian_support_desc:0 "Poland desperately lacks friends and allies on the international stage, and we are out of options. The Russian Republic to the East is forming a new power bloc in Europe, and it may be to our advantage to seek Russia's protection, no matter how humiliating it might be."
POL_naval_interdiction_desc:0 "Rather than rebuilding a traditional navy, a process that may take decades, we should instead focus on precision strikes, to hit the enemy where it hurts most."

POL_naval_industry_desc:0 "Having retaken the historic city of Gdansk, we must use its massive ports and naval infrastructure to build a new Baltic fleet that will be the envy of Europe."
POL_gdansk_agreement_desc:0 "Our diplomatic position is stronger than it has ever been in the past 20 years. We must leverage this advantage to send a diplomatic envoy to Berlin, requesting the return of the rightful territory of Plotzk to the Polish people. It is unlikely to succeed, but there is no harm in trying..."

We have been stabbed in the back by our so called "allies", and it is time for Poland to take what is hers."
POL_militarism_desc:0 "The people of Poland have been cheated out of what we were rightfully owed, and they know it. We must whip the people into a frenzy of nationalism, so that we may fill our ranks with proud soldiers to fuel the coming conflicts."

POL_cossack_alliance_desc:0 "Syndicalists have seized power in Ukraine, and threaten our borders with their radical policies. We must strike first and strike quickly if we are to destroy this Syndicalist menace. The Cossacks may be amenable to a temporary alliance..."
POL_skewer_ukraine_desc:0 "Ukraine must be destroyed, and destroyed immediately. Our claims to the entire region are weak, but enough to justify a war, if we so wish."
POL_all_under_one_desc:0 "We must begin a blistering propaganda campaign to bring all the Polish people in line under Radek, so that he may move the nation forward as one."
POL_polish_exceptionalism_desc:0 "The Polish people must be taught that they are exceptional, that they are the strongest and greatest people in all of Europe. In doing so, they will fight harder and longer in time of war, and work harder and longer in times of peace."
POL_new_communes_desc:0 "We must move the nation's power out of the hands of the bourgeois and into the hands of the people. New and stronger communes will enhance the ability of the people to defend themselves against capitalist influences, and strengthen the resolve of our people."

POL_leninist_plan_desc:0 "Jakub Hanecki's sudden leadership of the Polish people will bring with it a revival of the old Leninist ideals which have been lost to the other Syndicalist powers of the world. These ideals will bring a unique strength to Poland which will empower her for years to come."
POL_luxembourg_world_revolution_desc:0 "Renowned revolutionary Róża Luksemburg's rise to power signifies a crucial policy shift outward and towards the spread of Syndicalism worldwide. Whether or not she can make good on those promises remains to be seen."

### Events ###
poland.1.t:0 "The Economy Fails!"
poland.1.d:0 "Germany is in a heavy economic crisis, and our dependence on them economically means that our own economy will be crippled. Our farmers are making no money due to the large decrease in prices of agricultural products and factories are preparing to fire thousands of workers. It seems that this summer will be hard for the Polish people, both in the cities and in countryside. We need to take countermeasures before the unrest begins."
poland.1.a:0 "Send additional police to the countryside!"
poland.1.b:0 "The Kingdom has failed! Long live the Republic!"

poland.2.t:0 "Bombing in Warsaw"
poland.2.d:0 "Yesterday, over fifty people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in a deadly bombing in Warsaw. The police doesn't yet know anything about who did it, but it is widely assumed that the Polish Underground Anarchist Party is responsible for the attack on the 'bourgeois'."
poland.2.a:0 "A horrendous day!"

poland.3.t:0 "March on Myslenice"
poland.3.d:0 "A local nationalist leader, Adam Doboszynski, decided to mobilise his branch of the 'Patriots for Saving Poland' organisation and march through Poland. Things however did not go peaceably as Doboszynski decided to disarm the local police after Syndicalists attacked his men. It's a sign of serious problems in our country!"
poland.3.a:0 "Send the army in and arrest everyone involved in this putsch!"

poland.4.t:0 "General unrest in the countryside!"
poland.4.d:0 "Since our national exports have fallen, our economy is so weak that it cannot support production. Prices are plummeting and thousands of peasants are demanding the government do something about the economic crisis. Peasant hatred has passed onto the gentry and the authorities, policemen have reported they are having a hard time in keeping peace in the countryside."
poland.4.a:0 "Can this get any worse?"

poland.5.t:0 "Ukrainian Terror!"
poland.5.d:0 "With the incorporation of Galicia the number of Ukrainians in our country has increased greatly. The larger cities of Eastern Galicia are populated by a majority of Poles, but the countryside the opposite is true and there are a majority of Ukrainians. Disenfranchised Ukrainians who are very unhappy about being part of Poland and have set up an organisation called the 'Ukrainian Insurgent Army' that is starting to attack our military and government officials."
poland.5.a:0 "This is really bad!"

poland.6.t:0 "Solutions for our Immense Problems"
poland.6.d:0 "Now we face two crises, a weak economy and a crisis of authority caused by the former. The police and the army are having serious problems keeping the country together. We need to seriously rethink our policies."

With the remaining authorities sceptical of their own ability to retain what power they have left, most have given up and...."

poland.9.t:0 "Another attempt at a King of Poland"
poland.9.d:0 "Just after the Weltkrieg, the Regency Council made an attempt to elect a king of Poland. This attempt, however, was stalled by the Polish inability to firmly support a single candidate and by the Central Powers' apparent lack of interest. Now, with the 20th anniversary of Kingdom of Poland's proclamation approaching, the Regency Council wants to make one last attempt."
poland.9.a:0 "Let us try again."

poland.10.t:0 "The Polish Election"
poland.10.d:0 "The Polish Regency Council has announced that it will again attempt to elect a King. Many in Lithuania see this as the perfect chance to recreate the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. If we were able to do that, it would unite us once more with our Polish brothers and the Commonwealth would be a power to be reckoned with. Should we declare our desire to recreate the Commonwealth or just let the Poles try and elect a King?"
poland.10.a:0 "Announce our desire to recreate the Commonwealth."
poland.10.b:0 "Wish them luck."

poland.11.t:0 "Lithuanians and the Commonwealth"
poland.11.d:0 "The Lithuanians have declared a renewed interest in recreating the Commonwealth. While in the past the Commonwealth was a major power in Europe it eventually was destroyed by Russia, Austria and Prussia. Because of this, some people have said we should forget the Commonwealth and instead start the election for a King. What should our response be to the Lithuanians?"
poland.11.a:0 "Agree to the proposal."
poland.11.b:0 "Ban Mindaugas from the election."
poland.11.c:0 "Proceed with the election."

poland.12.t:0 "The Polish have Shunned Us!"

poland.12.a:0 "Curse them!"

poland.13.t:0 "The Polish Election"
poland.13.d:0 "The Lithuanians under Mindaugas III had proposed a reborn Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to the Polish Regency Council. Thankfully, the Council not only rejected the proposal, but banned Mindaugas from the election. Many officials are calling for us to pressure the council to elect Friedrich Christian Wettin as the new King of Poland to ensure the Poles do nothing to upset our interests. What should we do?"
poland.13.a:0 "Pressure the Poles to elect Friedrich Christian Wettin."
poland.13.b:0 "Wish them luck."

poland.14.t:0 "The Council has Ignored Us"
poland.14.d:0 "After declaring our desire to recreate the Commonwealth, the Polish Regency Council has simply ignored us! While we do not have the diplomatic power to do much more then complain, Germany certainly does have the ability to do so. Should we ask the Germans to help us create a new Commonwealth?"
poland.14.a:0 "Ask for Germany's help."
poland.14.b:0 "Let the Poles have their election."

poland.15.t:0 "Lithuania has Asked for Help"
poland.15.d:0 "The Lithuanians are asking we help them recreate the Commonwealth. Supporting them would create both a strong ally and keep Poland out of the Habsburg's hands. However, some worry it would weaken our own position in the region and instead we should support Friedrich Christian Wettin to become the new King of Poland. What should we do?"
poland.15.a:0 "Pressure the Poles to elect Mindaugas III."
poland.15.b:0 "Pressure the Poles to elect Friedrich Christian Wettin."
poland.15.c:0 "Don't interfere with the election."

poland.16.t:0 "Choosing the King"

poland.22.d:0 "The Polish are attempting another election for a King and Mindaugas III is an official candidate. We would clearly lose Poland if he was elected so many officials are calling for the removal of Mindaugas III.

poland.25.t:0 "The Austrian Demand"
poland.25.d:0 "The Austrians have sent a demand to us bluntly stating to remove Mindaugas III of Lithuania from the list of potential Kings. The obvious choice is to agree to the demand, but we could elect Mindaugas III on the spot to free ourselves of the Austrians, or finally, we could ignore their demands and proceed with the election. What should we do?"
poland.25.a:0 "Comply and remove Mindaugas III."
poland.25.b:0 "Ignore their demand."
poland.25.c:0 "Elect Mindaugas III now!"

poland.26.t:0 "The Polish have Shunned Us!"
poland.26.d:0 "The Polish Regency Council has declared our King to be invalid as a possible King of Poland. It's obvious however, that the Council's master, the Austrians, ordered them to do this."

poland.126.d:0 "As tension mounts in the halls of Europe, the Regency Council has been hotly debating whether or not they should increase the size of the desks in the Council chambers. Many are for it, while many are against, and factions have divided members of the Council around their perceived votes. The debates have been printed on the front page of Polish newspapers, sparking outrage among citizens."
poland.126.a:0 "A larger work space is critical!"
poland.126.b:0 "Who cares?"

poland.127.t:0 "The Council Regains Focus"
poland.127.d:0 "Now, even the Regency Council is feeling the immense pressure from the growing chaos in Poland. After settling many petty disputes still being debated, the Regency Council seems finally poised to crown a new King of Poland in the coming days."
poland.127.a:0 "Finally!"

poland.128.t:0 "Joining the Austrian Sphere"
poland.128.d:0 "Austria has recently formed a new sphere of politically aligned states to replace their old empire. Poland finds herself in a precarious position in Europe, and by joining the Austrian Federation, we could gain the protection of the other members. As a fellow Habsburg, the king is leaning towards this option..."
poland.128.a:0 "Joining the Austrians will secure our future."

poland.129.t:0 "Poland Looks for Protection"
poland.129.d:0 "With the recent election of [POL.GetLeader], Poland has been inching ever closer into our sphere of influence. This has culminated in their interest in joining our new military alliance as a member state, seeking our protection from outside threats."
poland.129.a:0 "We are stronger together."
poland.129.b:0 "We don't need those weaklings!"

poland.130.t:0 "The Return of Galicia"
poland.130.d:0 "With the brotherly relationship between our new King [POL.GetLeader] and [AUS.GetLeader], we can use this opportunity to peaceably press our claims to Galicia, a region that has been a historical part of the Polish Kingdom since ages long past."
poland.130.a:0 "Galicia deserves our benevolent leadership!"

poland.131.t:0 "Poland Requests Dominion over Galicia"
poland.131.d:0 "Poland, firmly in our sphere of influence since the election of [POL.GetLeader], has made an official diplomatic request for dominion over Galicia. The Poles have a fairly weak claim to the whole region, however their claim to Krakow is strong, where the majority of the people are Poles and would likely welcome a return to Poland proper. How shall we respond?"
poland.131.a:0 "Utterly ridiculous!"
poland.131.b:0 "Galicia is theirs by right."
poland.131.c:0 "They shall make do with only Krakow."

poland.132.t:0 "The Vilnius Accord"
poland.132.d:0 "With [POL.GetLeader] ruling both Poland and Lithuania as separate nations, even without a new Commonwealth we can still agree to a special relationship between our two nations, where each agrees to defend the other in a time of war."
poland.132.a:0 "We are safer together."

poland.133.t:0 "Poland Requests an Alliance"
poland.133.d:0 "Even with our rejection of a new Commonwealth, Poland is seeking to define a special relationship between our two nations, proposing a defensive alliance between our two nations, where each will agree to defend the other in a time of war. It is a tempting proposal, but how shall we respond?"
poland.133.a:0 "Of course!"
poland.133.b:0 "We don't need them!"

poland.134.t:0 "Protecting Lithuania"
poland.134.d:0 "With the growing relationship between us and Lithuania, and the collapse of Lithuania's old alliance in the Reichspakt, it is perhaps time to propose that Lithuania comes under our protection as a client state, so that we may better protect each other come a time of war."
poland.134.a:0 "They are safer under our protection."

poland.135.t:0 "Poland Seeks Our Submission"
poland.135.d:0 "With the collapse of Germany and the Reichspakt alliance, we have found ourselves in a precarious position. We are few on allies and our future looks grim. Poland, seeing this opportunity, has offered their protection in the form of us becoming a Polish client state. Are we really that desperate?"
poland.135.a:0 "Unfortunately, we need them."
poland.135.b:0 "Never!"

poland.136.t:0 "Austria Denies our Request"
poland.136.d:0 "Austria has denied us dominion over Galicia, favouring the current administration over our own."
poland.136.a:0 "Outrageous!"

poland.137.t:0 "Austria Acquiesces"
poland.137.d:0 "Austria has rightfully agreed to return the long-lost territory of Galicia to our rightful control, and has begun enacting procedures for the transfer of territory. This is a wonderful day for the Polish people."
poland.137.a:0 "Fantastic!"

poland.138.t:0 "The Return of Krakow"
poland.138.d:0 "While not outright denying our claims to Galicia, Austria has instead proposed that we take dominion only over the Polish-majority region of Krakow, and leave the rest to the current administrators. While this is not ideal, it is certainly welcome to own the historic city of Krakow again after all these years."
poland.138.a:0 "Our people, reunited."

poland.139.t:0 "The Accords Succeed"
poland.139.d:0 "Lithuania has accepted our proposal for a defensive alliance, and both nations now stand ready to defend each other from the threat of foreign invasions."
poland.139.a:0 "Just like old times!"

poland.140.t:0 "Lithuania Stands Alone"
poland.140.d:0 "Lithuania has refused our proposal for a defensive alliance, stating that they do not need our protection."
poland.140.a:0 "Then they shall die alone."

poland.141.t:0 "Lithuania Submits!"
poland.141.d:0 "In a desperate move, the Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal, submitting to our authority for their own benefit. This new relationship between our nations will surely benefit us both in the long term."
poland.141.a:0 "We shall care for them well."
poland.142.t:0 "Lithuania Defiant"
poland.142.d:0 "Lithuania has refused our offer of benevolent control, instead claiming that our offer is a grave insult to their ideals. Without our protection, they will surely be destroyed."
poland.142.a:0 "How could they?!"

poland.143.t:0 "Poland Seeks Plotzk"
poland.143.d:0 "After the election of [POL.GetLeader], Poland has been drifting ever closer into our sphere of influence. As a result of this close relationship, Poland is now seeking to acquire the territory of Plotzk from us, which has a large Polish majority. In exchange, Poland will renounce any and all claims they hold to other Polish-majority regions we control. If we were to agree, it would cement a strong relationship with Poland. However, for us to cede any territory would certainly be seen as a sign of weakness..."
poland.143.a:0 "It is a fair trade."
poland.143.b:0 "Us? Surrendering territory? Unthinkable!"

poland.144.t:0 "The Kaiser Agrees"
poland.144.d:0 "Germany has agreed to our proposal for the cession of Plotzk in exchange for us renouncing our claims on other Polish territory they hold. With this transfer of territory, we can now welcome back millions of our brethren back into Poland proper."
poland.144.a:0 "R-really?"

poland.145.t:0 "An Unacceptable Trade"
poland.145.d:0 "The Kaiser has flatly denied our request for territory, stating that they only deal with "proper nations" and that we should learn our place in the European hierarchy. It seems like we shall not be seeing Plotzk under our care for some time."
poland.145.a:0 "To be expected..."

poland.146.t:0 "Poland Seeks Protection"
poland.146.d:0 "Looking outward from their current precarious position in Europe, the nascent Polish Republic has come to us with a request to join our alliance. While Poland is diplomatically isolated in Europe, it could prove worthwhile to have another ally in Europe, no matter how small."
poland.146.a:0 "All allies are welcome."
poland.146.b:0 "They can't possibly help us."

poland.147.t:0 "Poland Joins the Entente"
poland.147.d:0 "After expressing our interest in joining the international alliance, the Entente, we have been formally accepted into the alliance. It is reassuring to have strong allies in these uncertain times."
poland.147.a:0 "Wonderful!"

poland.148.t:0 "Poland Remains Alone"
poland.148.d:0 "After expressing our interest in joining the international alliance, the Entente, we have been told that our membership is not possible. The members of the alliance believe that our position in Europe is untenable, and that our membership would only be a drain on the rest of the alliance."
poland.148.a:0 "Understandable."

poland.149.t:0 "Poland Seeks Russian Aid"
poland.149.d:0 "The small Republic of Poland, a new nation on the European stage, is looking to us for their protection. The monarchies they are surrounded by only stand to threaten the new republic, and in a desperate move, they are seeking our help against foreign invaders."
poland.149.a:0 "Yesterday's enemy is today's friend."
poland.149.b:0 "This is surely a trap."

poland.150.t:0 "Russia Accepts"
poland.150.d:0 "Despite our past differences, Russia has seen fit to take us under their wing, giving us a strong ally against our adversaries in evil."
poland.150.a:0 "Unlikely bedfellows."

poland.151.t:0 "Russia Ignores Polish Pleas"
poland.151.d:0 "Seeking a diplomatic solution to our diplomatic isolation, we attempted to join the Russian Alliance in order to protect ourselves from outside threats. The Russians have denied our entry into their alliance, stating that the small Polish nation is of no use to their interests. Poland stands alone."
poland.151.a:0 "Our past differences were too great."

poland.161.t:0 "Poland Joins the Internationale?"
poland.161.d:0 "After their recent Syndicalist revolution, the small nation of Poland is seeking to join the ranks of Syndicalism worldwide, the Internationale. Should we allow them into our ranks?"
poland.161.a:0 "Our brothers!"
poland.161.b:0 "Their belief in our cause is flimsy."

poland.162.t:0 "The Internationale Grows!"
poland.162.d:0 "The French Commune has accepted our entry to the Internationale! We stand firm with our brothers in Syndicalism!"
poland.162.a:0 "The wheels of revolution turn!"

poland.163.t:0 "The Commune Dismisses Polish Interest"
poland.163.d:0 "Seemingly distrusting the new Syndicalist regime in Poland, the Commune has denied our entry into the Internationale, stating that our belief in their ideals is too weak. Without the help of the Internationale, our future in Europe looks bleak."
poland.163.a:0 "Impossible!"

poland.164.t:0 "Emergency Elections"
poland.164.d:0 "Normally the Sejm elections are held every 4 years, however, with the formation of the new Republic, we have sudden need to hold immediate elections to form the new Republic's Sejm. There are many parties that could come out on top..."

poland.164.b:0 "The People's Coalition"
poland.164.c:0 "National-Radical Party"
poland.164.e:0 "The Syndicalist Party"

poland.165.t:0 "The Situation of Poland in 1936"
poland.165.d:0 "Until the end of the Weltkrieg, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. Polish fortunes turned in 1916, though, with the Act of November 5th, where it was granted autonomy from the collapsing Russia. However, this triumph came with a bitter taste, as the election of a Polish king was postponed again and again between 1921 and 1936 as Austria-Hungary and Germany squabbled about the nationality of a possible king and the exact status of a Polish kingdom. Hence, the regency of Janusz Radziwill continues. However, all hope of a Polish kingdom is not over: the Ausgleich of 1937 is eagerly looked forward to in Warsaw as the time when the future of Poland is decided. However, certain forces in Warsaw are tired of being under the Austro-German yoke, and looks towards their 'enslaved' brothers in Germany, Austria and the eastern states, hoping to one day create a kingdom for all Poles."
poland.165.a:0 "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła!"

poland.173.t:0 "Poland Invites Us to the Internationale"
poland.173.d:0 "Poland has moved on to joining the Internationale, leaving us in a precarious position on our own. Should we follow their lead and join the Internationale as well?"
poland.173.a:0 "We are stronger together."
poland.173.b:0 "We are stronger alone."

poland.174.t:0 "Ukraine Accepts our Invitation"
poland.174.d:0 "Ukraine has accepted our invitation to continue our alliance by joining the Internationale, following our example."
poland.174.a:0 "As they should!"

poland.175.t:0 "Ukraine Declines our Invitation"
poland.175.d:0 "Ukraine has stated that they feel our alliance has run its course, and our joining the Internationale goes farther than they are willing to go. They shall stand alone."
poland.175.a:0 "A blunder, surely."

poland.176.d:0 "The region of Galicia is rightfully ours, and we shall take it by force if need be!"

poland.177.t:0 "Poland Demands Galicia!"
poland.177.d:0 "Poland has sent us an ultimatum, return their territory or they will take it by force. Their ability to make good on these threats is uncertain, but we cannot simply ignore their threat."

There has been a deafening silence in opposition to this message, indicating a complete victory for the monarchist faction.

News of the king's passing has devastated the nation, and the Polish people mourn across the country. However, a problem now faces the nation. The king's only son, Ludwik, is too young to ascend to the throne and will be for some time. This requires that a new Regency Council will take control of the nation for the next decade while the young Ludwik matures. The Polish nation is king-less once more."

These pacts were continuously signed by elected kings from 1573 to 1764 as a sign of good faith on the part of the monarch. This pact affirmed the king's pledges to the nation, and was written uniquely for each king to sign upon election to the Polish throne.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of King [POL.GetLeader]'s ascension to the throne, the Sejm has written a new Pacta Conventa for the king to sign. A king has not ruled the Polish people for almost 150 years, and many have come to see the king's signing of this document as the de facto beginning of Poland's new age in the modern world."

poland.215.a:0 "Here's to twenty more years!"

poland.216.t:0 "Choosing the King"
poland.216.d:0 "For over 20 years Poland has not had a King. However, another election by the Regency Council may finally change that. Unfortunately, our status as a client state of Germany has ensured the election is anything but fair. The Regency Council chamber is filled with German "observers", and none have any doubts as to the outcome of this "election"."
poland.217.t:0 "Choosing the King"
poland.217.d:0 "For over 20 years Poland has not had a King. However, another election by the Regency Council may finally change that. Unfortunately, our status as a client state of Germany has ensured the election is anything but fair. The Regency Council chamber is filled with German "observers", and none have any doubts as to the outcome of this "election"."

poland.218.t:0 "Meddling in the Polish Election"
poland.218.d:0 "The Poles have recently made moves to elect a new king, after 20 years of regency. This election presents the perfect opportunity for us to bring the Polish into our sphere of influence. We could support Karl Albrecht von Habsburg for the new King of Poland, as his election would surely bring Poland closer to us. What should we do?"
poland.218.a:0 "Pressure the Poles to elect Karl Albrecht von Habsburg."
poland.218.b:0 "Do not interfere."

poland.219.t:0 "[POL.GetLeader]'s Inaugural Address"
poland.219.d:0 "As the first president of the new Polish Republic, [POL.GetLeader] gave a rousing inaugural speech today outside of Belvedere Palace, the building selected as the seat of the new presidency. In his speech, [POL.GetLeader] promised to unite all the Polish people together in these uncertain times, and made wide promises of reform and a movement away from the old days of the Regency Council. The speech was met with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, who came waving Polish flags and banners of the new Republic."
poland.219.a:0 "A moving speech."

poland.220.t:0 "Raising Modlin Fortress"
poland.220.d:0 "With the recent increase in tensions, our military is reviewing old fortresses for renewed service. One of the contenders is Modlin fortress, a massive fortification on the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula near Warsaw. Constructed by Napoleon in 1806 as a key fortification in his campaign against Russia, and later used by the Russians themselves, the fortress nevertheless still commands an important strategic position in the region.\n\nShould we renovate the fortress?"
poland.220.a:0 "Raise the fortress."
poland.220.b:0 "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere."

poland.221.t:0 "Poland Joins the Vienna Circle"
poland.221.d:0 "Responding to our expansion of the Vienna Circle, our dynastic relatives in Poland have made apparent their desire to join, and have sent their own representatives to Vienna to participate."
poland.221.a:0 "They are most welcome."
poland.222.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Raszyn"
poland.222.d:0 "Ealier today the first broadcasts could be heard throughout the nation from the newest radio station operated by Polskie Radio S.A. in Raszyn. This radio station, the strongest in Europe, had a power of 120 kilowatts and could be heard from hundreds of kilometers away. This long-range station will allow all Polish citizens nationwide to hear the news and other important information from the comfort of their own homes."
poland.222.a:0 "A fantastic achievement."

poland.223.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Warsaw II"
poland.223.d:0 "Continuing the expansion of their national radio network, Polskie Radio S.A. has today begun broadcasting from their second permanent radio station in Warsaw, bringing their total number of stations to five. These stations and their coverage of Poland proper ensure that Polish radio broadcasts reach Polish people all across Europe, even crossing national boundaries."
poland.223.a:0 "The Polish voice knows no bounds."

poland.224.t:0 "Cabinet Crisis"
poland.224.d:0 "In December 1937 'Kurier Warszawski', one of the most influential newspapers in Poland, published a number of articles accusing a few members of current cabinet of stealing public funds. An investigation into the matter has proven the accusation as correct. King [GetLeader] will likely use this opportunity to change the cabinet as he sees fit, and gain more control over the government's policies."
poland.224.a:0 "Keep the current government."
poland.224.b:0 "The Prime Minister must be replaced."

poland.225.t:0 "Deposition of the King's Brother"
poland.225.d:0 "Rising on a swelling tide of populist action, the "Red Hetman", as he is being called by the unwashed masses, Nikita Krushchev, has moved to depose the current ruler of Ukraine, Vasily I. Normally events in Ukraine would not concern the Polish crown, however, Vasily I was the brother of the current king of Poland, Karl Albrecht. Obviously such an aggressive action against the king's own brother is an outrage, and one we must deal with immediately."
poland.225.a:0 "We will not forget this."
poland.225.b:0 "This is an outrage! War!"

poland.226.t:0 "War with Germany!"
poland.226.d:0 "The time has come, for one of our greatest foes has come bearing down upon us once more. Germany, ever an enemy of the Polish people, now stands fimrly opposite us on the battlefield, ready to take all we hold dear. It is time for the greatest fight of our generation, where we decide the fate of Poland for generations to come."
poland.226.a:0 "We will fight to the bitter end."

poland.227.t:0 "Poland's Syndicalist Revolution"
poland.227.d:0 "The Kingdom of Poland, a small rump state born from the wreckage of the Weltkrieg in the middle of Europe, has had its government collapse in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution. We have strong economic and political interests in keeping the Poles within our sphere of influence, and this revolution transforms them from a weak backwater into a potential threat.\n\nLessons from the Weltkrieg have taught us the dangers of a two-front war. We cannot allow the Poles to consolidate their nation and potentially align themselves with the French Commune."
poland.227.a:0 "Draft a list of demands. This cannot stand."
poland.227.b:0 "We are busy elsewhere."

poland.228.t:0 "Germany Sends Demands"
poland.228.d:0 "German observers in Poland, previously sidelined by the near-total collapse of the old regime, today quietly delivered a missive to the office of the new Syndicalist head of state, comrade [POL.GetLeader].\n\nThe note came from the German foreign office, and its message was as vindictive as it was clear. The new Polish government was in no way recognized by the German Empire, as is seen as a rebel force fighting in defiance of the true government of the Kingdom of Poland. The current 'rebels' were to submit to a list of no less than 16 demands, and to retreat from their offices in Warsaw, to be replaced by 'proper authorities' under German supervision.\n\nIt is clear that this list of demands was never meant to be accepted, and is nothing but a pretext for an imperialist German war."
poland.228.a:0 "This is outrageous, the Kaiser has no power here!"
poland.228.b:0 "We are surrounded by German puppets, to fight is to die."

poland.229.t:0 "Poland Refuses to Surrender"
poland.229.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. The communication sent back to Berlin was so offensive and full of foul language that it was said to be more curse than communique.\n\nHowever crudely worded, the message was clear. The Syndicalists will not submit to proper German authority, and we have acquired a reasonable casus belli to remove them from our borders."
poland.229.a:0 "Crush them."

poland.230.t:0 "Poland Agrees to Cooperation"
poland.230.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. Initially, no response seemed forthcoming from the Syndicalist government operating out of the Polish capital.\n\nHowever, this morning a message was received that outlined Poland's willingness to cooperate on all German demands and to restore the position of the monarch as head of the nation. Initially, the message was belived to be a hoax or some elaborate joke. However, it was quickly determined that the message was in fact genuine.\n\nIt appears that the threat of German intervention has scared the Syndicalists into submission. The Polish monarchy is to be restored as soon as possible, under German supervision."
poland.230.a:0 "They have seen the light."

poland.231.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy"
poland.231.d:0 "Tody the Polish monarchy saw its restoration under the eyes of a strict German military presence. All remnants of the short-lived Syndicalist regime have been removed from the public eye, and most Syndicliast leaders of note have fled into hiding.\n\nFor his part, the new Polish king, the German Fryderyk Krystian Saski, promised to uphold the will of the Polish people, and promised an era of healing and reconcilliation betwwen the Polish and German peoples. Poland has entered a new era in its history."
poland.231.a:0 "We have been humiliated, but the regency is over."

poland.232.t:0 "German Monopolies Crash"
poland.232.d:0 "In the wake of Germany's quick economic meltdown, many of the rail and mineral monopolies that have been feeding off of Polish land have found themselves bankrupt. With Germany in complete dissaray, now would seem like our best opportunity to seize their holdings and throw off Germany's economic stranglehold on Poland!"
poland.232.a:0 "Seize their assets!"

poland.233.t:0 "Polish Monopolies Crash"
poland.233.d:0 "In the wake of Black Monday, some of our corporate intersts in Poland have gone bankrupt. We have now recieved news that the Polish government, ever irritated at our economic interest in their country, have moved to seize our corporate assets in their country, effectively removing our control over their economy. This is a disaster!"
poland.233.a:0 "We won't forget this!"
