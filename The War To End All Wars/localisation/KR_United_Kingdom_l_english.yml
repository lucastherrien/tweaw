### Restoration of the UK ###
uk.1.t:0 "The Liberation of the United Kingdom"
uk.1.d:0 "After years of exile and struggle, the armed forces of the Union of Britain have been defeated and its leaders fled, while the Royal Family has returned to Britain in triumph. It is a glorious day for Britain and the Empire. God save the King!"
uk.1.a:0 "Restore the United Kingdom!"
uk.1.b:0 "...but I'll stay here!"

uk.2.t:0 "Lawrence Restores the United Kingdom"
uk.2.d:0 "News has reached the desk of King Edward VIII in Rideau Hall that Thomas Edward Lawrence, better known as T.E Lawrence has taken control in Britain and wrested power away from Mosley, who had tried to destroy Britain through tyrannical madness. Lawrence has sent a letter to the King requesting his return to the Home Islands to restore the monarchy and bring responsible government back to Britain. This is truly a historic day."
uk.2.a:0 "God bless you Lawrence."

uk.3.t:0 "The Restoration"
uk.3.d:0 "At long last, King Edward VIII entered Westminster Abbey to be properly crowned as virtually all English and later British monarchs have been throughout history. Today is a glorious day, a day that will mark a new beginning for the United Kingdom. However, following the coronation, the work to rebuild Britain has already begun. The army needs to be rebuilt, the economy needs to be restructured and the fate of the syndicalists must be decided upon."
uk.3.a:0 "Long Live the King."

uk.4.t:0 "Refugees from the Union of Britain"
uk.4.d:0 "The Royalists have somehow managed to defeat the Union of Britain. As a result, persecuted Syndicalists have fled across the Channel, seeking refuge on our shores. In addition, small elements of the former armed forces of the Union of Britain have reached the safety of our country, pledged to one day return to Britain and once again defeat the Royalists."
uk.4.a:0 "Welcome to our brothers in Syndicalism!"

uk.1000.t:0 "Liberty Day"
uk.1000.d:0 "Across Britain, stores and factories are closed, as the British gather in a national day of remembrance, in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against Syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V have been interred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by Edward VIII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures. This solemn act has finally fulfilled the late King's dying wish to return to Britain. After the ceremony, the King led a solemn procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled. During the unveiling, the King stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former Syndicalist regime, and that all had suffered, from the King to the lowest labourer. Never again, pledged the King, would Syndicalism threaten British liberties, which had been passed down through the ages. To honour the victims of Syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and so dearly regained, henceforth every [GetDateText] is to be celebrated as Liberty Day."
uk.1000.a:0 "For King and Country!"

### Liberty Day 2-100 ###
uk.1001.t:0 "Liberty Day"
uk.1001.d:0 "Across Britain, stores and factories are closed, as the British gather in a national day of remembrance, in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against Syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, attended by Edward VIII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures, the Royal Guard parades through the city. Never again, the King then pledged in speech in front of the masses assembled on the Mall, would syndicalism threaten the British liberties, which had been passed down through the ages. To honour the victims of syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and so dearly gained on this Liberty day."
uk.1001.a:0 "For King and Country!"

uk.1700.t:0 "Canadian technology for Britain"
uk.1700.d:0 "Now that the United Kingdom has been restored, Canadian technical expertise is flowing onto the island. Many technology companies have already set up shop across the pond again."
uk.1700.a:0 "For Science!"

### The Second Glorious Revolution ###
uk.6.t:0 "The Second Glorious Revolution"
uk.6.d:0 "Once again, the British people decided to overthrow a tyrannical regime and invite their righteous monarch back to reign over them. This time, they just needed a little more convincing. The new order has become firmly re-established in the Home Islands and it seems that the Syndicalist experiment in Britain is decidedly over."
uk.6.a:0 "Horrible!"
uk.6.b:0 "Glorious!"
### The British Reconstruction Authority ###
uk.7.t:0 "The British Reconstruction Authority"
uk.7.d:0 "While the monarchy has been restored to the British Isles, many policymakers argue that the country needs time to go through thorough 'de-syndicalisation'. Syndicalist rule permeated not only into Britain's politics and economic system, but laid its roots deep in British society and culture as well. To help overcome the legacy of Syndicalism, a 'British Reconstruction Authority', or BRA for short, has been created and granted wide governing powers to help rejuvenate Britain again."
uk.7.a:0 "God Save Britain."
### Return of the Aristocracy ###
uk.8.t:0 "Return of the Aristocracy"
uk.8.d:0 "With the triumph of the Royalists, the aristocracy has returned to Britain, only to find that their former lands had been expropriated by the Syndicalists and redistributed to peasants and farmers. These aristocrats naturally wish to have their land returned to them. Doing so will cause a great deal of disruption to the average person in Britain, not to mention anger them. It might be wiser to compensate the nobles for their loses."
uk.8.a:0 "Restore the lands of the nobility."
uk.8.b:0 "Compensate them for their losses."
#### Lords ###
uk.9.t:0 "Restore the House of Lords?"
uk.9.d:0 "In expectation of the first free general election in over a decade, the House of Commons has been refurbished and its powers delineated. However concerns have been raised about the restoration of the House of Lords, the upper legislative chamber that scrutinises laws made by the elected Commons. Many wonder whether the British population will still accept the House of Lords having a significant political role after so many years of abolishment."
uk.9.a:0 "The Lords are as vital as the Commons!"
uk.9.b:0 "Only one chamber is needed."
### The First Election ###
uk.10.t:0 "The Progressive Party"
uk.10.d:0 "While the three main political parties of the former exiles are preparing for the imminent general election, a fourth party has been organising. Known as the Progressive Party, it includes prominent intellectuals and other figures on the left, including some who had remained in Britain during the Syndicalist Interregnum. Some fear that the Progressives are merely a front for a Syndicalist resurgence, and that letting the party contest the general election will open the door for Syndicalist sympathisers to regain power."
uk.10.a:0 "Allow them to stand for election."
uk.10.b:0 "Ban them!"

uk.11.t:0 "British General Election"
uk.11.d:0 "After several months of preparations, the provisional government has completed arrangements for the first free election in Great Britain since the liberation. The King has formally issued the writ for the 660 seats in the House of Commons, and the various political parties have begun their campaigns. The question is, who shall win the chance to govern the United Kingdom in the years ahead?"
uk.11.a:0 "Conservative Party."
uk.11.b:0 "Imperial Party"
uk.11.c:0 "Liberal Party."
uk.11.e:0 "Progressive Party."
### The End of the British Reconstruction Authority ###
uk.12.t:0 "The End of the British Reconstruction Authority"
uk.12.d:0 "While the BRA has been instrumental in bringing Britain back from the brink and restoring its pre-Syndicalist legacy, its time is now at an end. The British people can finally hold their heads high and look to a better future, without the malign and corrosive influence of leftist ideology."
uk.12.a:0 "God Save the King!"
### First Election since the end of the BRA ###
uk.13.t:0 "[GetYear] British General Election"
uk.13.d:0 "With the end of the British Reconstruction Authority, the time has come to have another general election. This will be the first general election since the end of the British Reconstruction Authority, and the first in a United Kingdom supposedly scoured clean of Syndicalist influence. All the major parties have come out and are campaigning to enter 10 Downing Street. The question is, which party shall win?"
uk.13.a:0 "Conservative Party."
uk.13.b:0 "Imperial Party."
uk.13.c:0 "Liberal Party."
uk.13.e:0 "Progressive Party."

### Rebuilding London ###
uk.14.t:0 "Rebuilding London"
uk.14.d:0 "The city of London was damaged rather extensively in the liberation of the Home Islands from the syndicalists. As we focus on rebuilding the country, we must look to restoring our capital. Two plans have been assembled as to how to rebuild the city and both have their proponents. The first plan is to restore it in all its original glory and splendour, making London look as it did prior to the 1925 Revolution during our Golden Age. The second plan, formulated by the famed architect Edwin Lutyens, is the grandiosely named 'Imperial Plan'. Drawing on the ideas of Haussmann's renovation of Paris, the Plan calls for wide boulevards and a focus on imperial grandeur, with Lutyen's particular blend of Art Deco and Classical hybrid style."
uk.14.a:0 "Restore London to its original splendour!"
uk.14.b:0 "Lutyen's Imperial Plan seems more fitting for a new era."

uk.15.t:0 "London Restored"
uk.15.d:0 "After only a couple of years, the city of London has finally been rebuilt in its original glory and grandeur. All of the buildings have been restored to their condition as they were prior to the Second Interregnum. After over a decade, the physical traces of syndicalism have been expunged from the streets of London."
uk.15.a:0 "Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St Clement's!"

uk.16.t:0 "London Rebuilt"
uk.16.d:0 "After a couple of years the city of London has been restored following Lutyen's Imperial plan. The city has been transformed into a new imperial city reflecting the new grandeur of the Empire. With the plan complete the physical traces of syndicalism have been expunged from the streets of London."
uk.16.a:0 "A new London for a new Empire."

### The Beveridge Report ###
uk.20.t:0 "The Beveridge Report"
uk.20.d:0 "As we look to rebuild the nation, one of our ministers William Beveridge has submitted a reported officially titled 'Social Insurance and Allied Services'. Beveridge's report lays out in detail five so-called 'evils' that damage a harmonious society and stand in the way of rebuilding Britain, namely squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease. The report goes on to argue that we should implement a social welfare state to help the people. This has created furious debate within the government as some refuse out right to endorse the proposal with a number labelling Beveridge a syndicalist. All the same a number of conservative MPs have proposed their own bill which, while watered down, they argue will prevent people from reverting to syndicalist ideology again."
uk.20.a:0 "Support Beveridge's proposal."
uk.20.b:0 "Support the Conservative Bill instead."
uk.20.c:0 "No Syndicalist welfare in the new Britain!"
### The Fate of the Unions ###

uk.21.t:0 "Fate of the Unions"
uk.21.d:0 "The defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the Syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests. Some argue that we should do little more than regulate and keep an eye on them, while other say that they must be banned to prevent another event like the 1925 Revolution, a third group argues that we can co-op the Unions for our own purposes."
uk.21.a:0 "Allow the Unions to continue."
uk.21.b:0 "Co-op and control the Unions."
uk.21.c:0 "Ban the Unions."
### British Army and Navy ###
uk.22.t:0 "The British Army"
uk.22.d:0 "With the restoration of the United Kingdom, a number of new regiments have been formed to defend Great Britain from any syndicalist elements. Moreover, to help the British Army a number of Home Guard divisions have been called forth to help augment our military and help protect the island."
uk.22.a:0 "God Save the King!"

uk.23.t:0 "Canadian Navy Ships"
uk.23.d:0 "A good number of ships that were part of the Canadian Royal Navy have been transferred over to the restored United Kingdom."
uk.23.a:0 "Britannia triumphant, her ships rule the seas!"

### Reforming Empire ###
uk.50.t:0 "Reforming the Empire"
uk.50.d:0 "With our political problems resolved, it is time to focus on rebuilding the Empire. While it will take a long time for the Empire to be one that the Sun never sets on, we shall achieve that goal in time. The Sun shall never set on the British Empire again!"
uk.50.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"
### Irish Policy ###
uk.51.t:0 "Policy towards Ireland"
uk.51.d:0 "As we look to rebuild the British Empire one obvious question that has emerged is the status of Ireland. Following the Weltkrieg and then the Revolution of 1925 we had to give up control of Ireland. However now that we have resolved our issues, it is time to turn our attention to Ireland once again. While many military and political leaders agree that we need the Emerald Island in our orbit to prevent it from being used as a staging ground for hostile forces, they are divided as to how to handle this and three plans have been set out.\n\nThe first plan calls for signing a treaty to bring them into our orbit in exchange for formally giving up our claims to the island. The second plan calls for Home Rule to be established, since before the Weltkrieg began that was about to be put into effect. This would allow them to keep their independence as long as they accept that King Edward and his descendants are their rightful rulers. Finally we could just reconquer them outright and absorb them back into the Union."
uk.51.a:0 "Give up our claims and propose a treaty."
uk.51.b:0 "Propose Home Rule instead."
uk.51.c:0 "Ireland is ours. Renew the Act of the Union!"

uk.52.t:0 "The British Ultimatum"
uk.52.d:0 "The Irish government looked on with interest and concern as the Union of Britain collapsed under the Royalist offensive. While relations with the Syndicalists were often strained, there was great foreboding that a restored Royalist Britain might attempt to regain control over Ireland. With King Edward VIII back in London and the right in power, that is precisely what has occurred. An ultimatum has been delivered to the Irish government, requesting that the island submit itself once again to British rule. The response of Michael Collins can be easily imagined."
uk.52.a:0 "Submit to the British (Game Over)"
uk.52.b:0 "Erin Go Bragh!"

uk.53.t:0 "The Irish Government Accepts Our Demands"
uk.53.d:0 "The Irish government has seen the wisdom of the British request, and have decided to yield sovereignty over the island to the King's representatives. Even now, elements of the British armed forces are landing in the major ports and disarming the small Irish forces, while the civil service is expanding to meet the requirements of administering a second island. This has been a symbolic diplomatic triumph for King Edward VIII and His Majesty's Government."
uk.53.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"

uk.54.t:0 "The Irish Government Rejects Our demands"
uk.54.d:0 "Foolishly, the Irish government has rejected the British request to restore British control over the island. The question now is whether to resort to the use of force to ensure that British rights are respected and enforced or to drop the matter."
uk.54.a:0 "To war!"
uk.54.b:0 "Let the matter drop."

uk.55.t:0 "Proposal From London"
uk.55.d:0 "The British have proposed a treaty that would let them drop their claims over our island in exchange for joining the Entente. However this would mean abandoning any alliances we have made with other political blocs, however it might be necessary should we wish to avoid war with the restored United Kingdom."
uk.55.a:0 "We shall join the Entente."
uk.55.b:0 "We will never bow to English demands!"

uk.56.t:0 "The Irish Accepted Our Treaty"
uk.56.d:0 "The Irish government has accepted our treaty that we have proposed to them. As per our treaty we will be giving our claims to the island of Ireland and they shall join the Entente."
uk.56.a:0 "God Bless the Irish!"

uk.57.t:0 "The Irish Rejected Our treaty"
uk.57.d:0 "The Irish government has rejected our treaty instead refusing to stick to their current alliances and situation. Without any treaty, we shall keep our claims to the island and plan for the day when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland can be realised once again."
uk.57.a:0 "Bloody Irish."

uk.58.t:0 "The British Proposal"
uk.58.d:0 "Our friends in London have given us a proposal that never believed that we would ever see. In exchange for a treaty to cement the friendship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, they shall drop all claims to our Island. We could hardly have hoped for such a positive outcome."
uk.58.a:0 "Sign it!"

uk.59.t:0 "The Irish Accept"
uk.59.d:0 "The Irish government has accepted our treaty that we have proposed to them. As per our treaty we will be giving up our claims to the island of Ireland and we shall work on rebuilding the relations between our countries."
uk.59.a:0 "God bless the Irish."

uk.60.t:0 "Rejoining the Empire?"
uk.60.d:0 "The new British government have approached their counterparts here in Dublin with a proposal to re-admit Ireland into the British Empire. This would require little formal modification to the Irish constitution - Ireland would remain in control of her foreign and domestic policy, however she would have to swear allegiance to the British King. The idea causes a certain degree of uneasiness and the government is divided."
uk.60.a:0 "Home Rule it is!"
uk.60.b:0 "Never! Erin Go Bragh!"

uk.61.t:0 "Ireland Rejoins the Empire"
uk.61.d:0 "The Irish government have accepted our proposal to rejoin the British empire. As per the treaty we shall respect their independence as a dominion within the British Empire. But, let us rejoice for Ireland is back within the Empire."
uk.61.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"

uk.62.t:0 "Ireland Refuses to Rejoin the Empire"
uk.62.d:0 "The Irish government has declined our proposal, wishing to remain outside the Empire. Though not severe, it is a setback for the government's foreign policy."
uk.62.a:0 "Bloody Irish."

### The Dominions ###

uk.100.t:0 "Five Eyes Agreement"
uk.100.d:0 "As the United Kingdom works to restore the Empire to glory, one of the plans assembled in Whitehall is proposals for a 'Five Eyes' Programme. This programme would focus on cooperation between the intelligence agencies of Canada, the West Indies Federation, the United Kingdom, the Dominion of India, and Australasia. Such a programme would help prevent anything like 1925 from happening again."
uk.100.a:0 "Semper Occultus."

uk.101.t:0 "The Imperial War Cabinet"
uk.101.d:0 "In order to help restore the military might of the British Empire a new joint-planning group has been convened in London. The Imperial War Cabinet will have military representatives of the Dominions of Canada, India, Australasia and the West Indies Federation gathered under one roof to help plan out all military operations and integrate them under our control. This will make sure that any future war can utilise the combined might of the Empire and make sure that everyone plays to their strengths."
uk.101.a:0 "A solid step forward."

uk.102.t:0 "Naval Exercises"
uk.102.d:0 "Admirals in the Royal Navy have convened a set of joint naval exercises in order to restore the fighting strength of our seamen and improve relations between the various countries of the British Empire, many of whom are taking part with their own ships. The naval exercises conveniently also act to show off the might of the Royal Navy and remind our allies and rivals of the power we once wielded, and will do so again."
uk.102.a:0 "We should do this next year."

uk.103.t:0 "Naval Exercises"
uk.103.d:0 "A year has passed since our last naval exercises with the other dominions in the British Empire. Let us invite them again for another round to help foster improved relations and to give our naval forces some much needed experience."
uk.103.a:0 "Britannia Rules the Waves."

uk.104.t:0 "Naval Exercises"
uk.104.d:0 "Another year has arrived and another round of naval exercises have been conducted. Warships from each of the Dominions have arrived to demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire and each vessel is resplendent with elaborate flags and cheering crewmen. Our elaborate exercises are surely the envy of the entire world and a testament to the restoration of Britain's imperial hopes."
uk.104.a:0 "Britons never, never, never shall be slaves."

uk.105.t:0 "The UK Proposes the Sterling Area"
uk.105.d:0 "To foster economic cooperation between the UK and her allies, the British Government has come up with the idea of a Sterling Area. The Sterling Area would be a bloc of countries that will all use the Pound Sterling as their currency. While this would help increase and simplify commerce and trade across the Empire and Entente, it would symbolise a restoration of British hegemony to some extent. How should we answer this proposal?"
uk.105.a:0 "Count us in!"
uk.105.b:0 "'Subject partner', eh?"
uk.105.c:0 "Oh blimey, surely not!"

uk.106.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees to Join the Sterling Area"
uk.106.d:0 "[From.GetName] has agreed to our proposal of a common currency for British Empire and will use the Pound from now on."
uk.106.a:0 "Wonderful!"

uk.107.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Join the Sterling Area"
uk.107.d:0 "[From.GetName] has not agreed to our proposal of a common currency for British Empire and will continue to use its own currency, albeit still connected to the Pound."
uk.107.a:0 "Bollocks!"

uk.108.t:0 "Pound Sterling Abolished"
uk.108.d:0 "In light of the recent developments, the Pound Sterling is no longer our official currency. This will cause some economic upheaval, but will ultimately be for the best."
uk.108.a:0 "Let's hope so..."

uk.109.t:0 "British India"
uk.109.d:0 "Since the restoration of the United Kingdom in the Home Islands, the British government has expended great energy to reward the Crown Jewel and make sure that we who have stayed true to the Crown are rewarded.
