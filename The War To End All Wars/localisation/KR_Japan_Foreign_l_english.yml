### Events ###
japfor.1.t:0 "Mantetsu Declares Record Earnings"
japfor.1.d:0 "After the conclusion of the last phase of the Chinese Civil Wars in 1928, and our intervention to protect our sphere of influence against German encroachment, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique proclaimed itself as the sole legitimate republican government of all China. Following the promulgation of an Imperial Ordinance ordering the development of "indivisible relations with the Japanese Empire", the government has supported a number of programs impressing our influence over its government so as to its role as an effective proxy in China. As a result, we maintain a great deal of influence over Fengtian, further reinforced by garrisons.\n\nThe core of our efforts is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or "Mantetsu" for short, which has been operating in Manchuria since 1906. While a powerful symbol of our interests in China prior to the intervention, the company has since become responsible for developing and exploiting virtually every important aspect of the Manchurian economy, propelling China's Northeast to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soybean supply. Today, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."

As part of a diplomatic treaty, we have allowed a major railway to run between the two nations as a symbol of unity. Ironically, the railway is now serving to justify war. The colonel of the Japanese garrison protecting the railway has staged an incident resulting in the deaths of 25 Manchurians and 12 Japanese, claiming Qing aggression as the cause."

japfor.12.t:0 "Compromise"
japfor.12.d:0 "The Germans have offered both sides a compromise: we give our portion of Inner Mongolia to the Japanese in exchange for peace. The Japanese have already accepted the deal, do we?"

japfor.12.b:0 "We won't give them an inch!"

japfor.13.t:0 "The Qing Empire accepts the Compromise"
japfor.13.d:0 "The Qing have accepted the German engineered compromise and we have received the Qing held territory in the Inner Mongolia region."

japfor.35.b:0 "Do Nothing."

japfor.36.t:0 "The Japanese have issued an ultimatum"
japfor.36.d:0 "The Japanese Consul in Saigon has delivered a letter from Tokyo.

japfor.43.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts our Conditions"

japfor.44.d:0 "With the eruption of the grand military conflict in Asia, some important members of our general staff have suggested the direct involvement of our colony the A.O.G. in the ongoing conflict, since its vast armies and strategic location could decisively turn the tide in our favour. Still, the A.O.G. board of directors warns us that, although they are willing to help the fatherland, this effort could seriously destabilise the already fragile situation in their colony..."

japfor.47.t:0 "Japanese Demands"
japfor.47.d:0 "Since the eruption of the conflict in Western Europe, Germany's position in Asia has seriously weakened. Japan has decided to use this opportunity to force us into submission. Their ambassador has brought us an official demand regarding a total political and economic restructuring of our state. Accepting this would mean an end of our status as an independent state. However, fighting an obviously strong Japan could mean complete disaster for us and the entirety of China. How shall we react?"

japfor.47.b:0 "Refuse them outright!"

japfor.48.t:0 "Submission of the Qing Empire"

japfor.50.t:0 "Japan invites us to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"
japfor.50.d:0 "The Japanese, seeing an empty space now that the Americans have decided to leave, invited us to join their alliance. This could be chance to make our nation rich and prosperous, but it could be deadly as Japan needs new markets and wants to spread its political influence."

japfor.60.t:0 "Japan's Diplomatic Efforts"
japfor.60.d:0 "A high level envoy from Japan has brought a plan that would guarantee our independence while giving Japan the military bases it needs to secure the Pacific Ocean. It is unlikely a negative answer will be taken well..."

japfor.61.t:0 "Hawaii refused our Offer"
japfor.61.d:0 "Our envoy in Hawaii reports the government have refused our generous offer to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Should we press this any further?"

japfor.68.t:0 "Korean Exiles Look for Foreign Backing"
japfor.68.d:0 "The Korean government-in-exile has trudged along for a long time alone building up minor support. However the growing instability in Japan may give them a a chance to return to Korea. We have received word they are putting out feelers for a strong ally to help them in their fight for independence."
japfor.68.a:0 "Troubling."

japfor.69.t:0 "Korea asks for Aid"
japfor.69.d:0 "The Korean government-in-exile has approached the German government for military and political aid in retaking their lands from Japan. This would cause much grief to the Japanese should we go to war with them, but it might also cause other problems for us should Korea jump the guns."
japfor.69.a:0 "A great place to drop left over equipment."
japfor.69.b:0 "Full support and aid shall be given."
japfor.69.c:0 "We're not interested."

japfor.70.d:0 "The Korean government in exile has asked us for military and political aid against Japan. It might be wise to send them aid to keep the Japanese off balanced. But it could mean that Japan comes for us sooner rather than later."

japfor.751.t:0 "Japanese Pressure"
japfor.751.d:0 "The rise of Korean nationalism in our state has made Japan a bit nervous and they are insisting that we crack down on this fledgling movement. Failure to do so could draw Japan's ire, but such measures will make the people restless, especially our middle class which contains a great number of Koreans."
japfor.751.a:0 "We have no choice..."

japfor.77.t:0 "Japan marches on Vladivostok"
japfor.77.d:0 "In order to force our hand, Japanese forces have marched on our capital and placed it under siege. We are not militarily strong enough to resist them in a full-on conflict."

japfor.78.t:0 "Troubles in Transamur"

japfor.88.t:0 "Korea fights us off"
japfor.88.d:0 "Korean forces have taken many key strategic positions and are forcing us off the mainland. Transamur and the Fengtian Government are noticing this and might decide to rebel as well. Should we seek peace?"

japfor.88.b:0 "We must keep Korea within our grasp!"

japfor.89.t:0 "Japan shows Weakness in Korea"
japfor.89.d:0 "Japan has decided to give up Korea and now we have a choice to make. With our former masters defeated should we break away and choose our own direction?"

japfor.104.d:0 "With the Korean peninsula engulfed in the fires of revolution, many hostile nations might use this event as an opportunity to weaken our influence in the pacific by direct or indirect support of those damned revolutionaries.

japfor.106.t:0 "Enforcing Naval Blockade"
japfor.106.d:0 "Our glorious navy continues to maintain a complete naval blockade around the rebellious Korean peninsula, denying the rebels much needed foreign aid.

japfor.110.t:0 "Japanese Settlers in Korea"
japfor.110.d:0 "During the occupation of Korea by the Japanese Empire, thousands of Japanese were settled within our borders, founding many new farms and villages. With our independence regained, however, we could very well seize those lands and redistribute them among our own people! However, such a populist move could harm our fragile economy, as a good part of our agricultural production comes from these farms."
japfor.110.a:0 "Seize the farms and expel the Japanese."

japfor.111.t:0 "Refugees from Korea"

japfor.115.d:0 "In 1921 Mongolia occupied part of the Russian Siberian provinces.

Until now only their internal and military weakness discouraged them from do so by force. But now, with Russia stable, their interests shifted here once more. We can greatly hasten our invasion if we allow Russia to take part in our plans to remove the Mongolian state as threat to stability in Eastern Asia"

But now the Japanese Empire, which views Mongolian state as a threat to stability in Eastern Asia, has offered to participate in their plans to conquer Mongolia."
japfor.117.a:0 "An excellent proposition."
japfor.117.b:0 "This will have to wait."

japfor.118.t:0 "Pact of Vladivostok Signed"
japfor.118.d:0 "In Vladivostok, at the behest of their heads of state, a Russian and Japanese delegation signed an agreement to invade Mongolia together. After the defeat of Mongolia, Russia will reclaim their former land. In turn, Russia will give Japan free reign within Mongolia."
japfor.118.a:0 "Excellent."

japfor.120.t:0 "Russia Refused our Offer"
japfor.120.d:0 "Russia refused our proposition to invade Mongolia together. Once again the Russian state has shown the world its utter weakness."

japfor.124.t:0 "Mongolia is in Disarray"
japfor.124.d:0 "With Mongolia in turmoil, we have a great opportunity to seize control over stolen parts of the Trans-Siberian railway. There is very little that either Mongolia or Japan can do to stop us at this point."
japfor.124.a:0 "Seize Northern Mongolia!"
japfor.124.b:0 "Rather not."

japfor.125.t:0 "Russia Seizes Northern Mongolia!"
japfor.125.d:0 "With newly conquered Mongolia in chaos, the Russians used this opportunity to seize control over disputed territory around the Trans-Siberian railway. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop the Russian state at this point."

japfor.130.t:0 "The Fate of The Mad Baron"
japfor.130.d:0 "With the defeat of the Mongolia state, Baron Roman Nikolai Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg, known as the mad baron, has fallen into our hands. What shall we do with this dangerous lunatic?"
japfor.130.a:0 "We don't fear him. Let him be."
japfor.130.b:0 "Extradite him to Russia."

japfor.131.b:0 "Exile him to the worst part of Siberia."

japfor.132.t:0 "Mad Baron escaped!"
japfor.132.d:0 "A fanatic supporter of the overthrown mad baron was able to free him. We should have open eyes in Mongolia for he might try to return..."
japfor.132.a:0 "Damn!"

japfor.133.t:0 "A New Alliance?"
japfor.133.d:0 "Recent cooperation with Russian state in the conquest of Mongolia proved the dramatic resurrection of the Russian armed forces. Conquest of Siberia would be extremely difficult if we are to face this united and strong Russian army, fighting on its own soil. Perhaps we should use this change in relations as signal to re-orientate our expansions towards safer goals, such as fragmented China or the unstable pacific. And, perhaps we could try and bring belligerent Russia, whose ambitions are clearly aimed against German hegemony in Pacific and Europe, into our block in order to secure our northern flank."

japfor.134.t:0 "An Alliance with Japan?"

Japan decided to offer us participation in their alliance bloc, which is clearly aimed against German dominance in the Pacific and Asia, and want to form an alliance with us. How we shall respond?"

japfor.135.a:0 "Excellent."

japfor.136.t:0 "Russian Demands"
japfor.136.d:0 "The Russians have agreed in principle to an alliance aimed against German Empire and its allies in Asia, but as a precondition of their direct military support they want the return of territories taken by Japan during the Russian civil war, namely northern Sakhalin and Primorsk."
japfor.136.a:0 "This is reasonable, accept."
japfor.136.b:0 "Never!"

japfor.137.t:0 "Negotiations Collapse"

japfor.137.a:0 "Oh well..."

japfor.138.t:0 "Transamur is Russian!"
japfor.138.d:0 "Facing the threat of Russian military force and deprived of the support of the local capitalists and the Japanese, Transamur's government is ready to collapse in the face of popular discontent. We can now do what we like with Transamur, but it has been independent for a long time and will be difficult to integrate into our country. Perhaps some sort of compromise is needed?"
japfor.138.a:0 "No compromise - put the leadership on trial and incorporate Transamur"
japfor.138.b:0 "Administer Transamur as an autonomous zone. For now."

japfor.139.t:0 "Peace with Japanese Empire?"
japfor.139.d:0 "Our military campaign against the Japanese Empire has been a military catastrophe so far. Nearly the whole of East-Siberia has fallen. Many politicians are demanding a peace treaty with Japan to end this war, even if at great expense..."

japfor.139.b:0 "No! No surrender!"

japfor.140.t:0 "Russia's Peace Offer"

japfor.144.b:0 "The turning point is near."

japfor.145.t:0 "Russia Offers Siberia for Peace"
japfor.145.d:0 "Our glorious troops have reached the Ural mountains. The humiliated Russian leadership is offering us control over whole Siberia if we sign peace with the broken Russian state. On the other hand, we have reached our main target to bring Siberia under direct military control and continuing this military struggle would serve little purpose."
japfor.145.a:0 "Better than we expected, accept the conditions."
japfor.145.b:0 "No Peace with the Russians!"

japfor.148.t:0 "Fate of Siberia"
japfor.148.d:0 "Now Siberia is under our direct control. We can either release it as independent state of Siberia, turn it over to Transamur, divide it between them, or keep it for ourselves."

japfor.191.t:0 "Indonesia begs for help!"
japfor.191.d:0 "Last week the Japanese have demanded Indonesia to fully capitulate to them in formal annexation. The Indonesians have come begging to us to protect them from the Japanese agression.

japfor.202.d:0 "When the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, two of the largest in our country, requested payment on their loans in quick succession, Fengtian's Central Bank defaulted due to a sudden and supposedly inexplicably insufficient silver reserve. Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help.\n\nWhile our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence. We have the option of bailing them out."
japfor.202.a:0 "We have no choice"
japfor.202.b:0 "This is of their own making"

japfor.203.t:0 "Fengtian Blames us for the Silver Crisis!"
japfor.203.d:0 "Fengtian has loudly denounced our government, citing what they say is a deliberate plot to destabilise their government through the eruption of their recent Silver Crisis, citing the incidental requests from both the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank for repayment on loans backed by Fengtian's silver reserve. With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation.\n\nAll the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"
japfor.203.a:0 "False accusations!"

japfor.204.t:0 "Fengtian Expels our Military Mission"
japfor.204.d:0 "Fengtian has expelled our military mission, giving them twenty four hours to leave the country, taking with them all equipment and other property. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the Mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity. Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private of course, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan.\n\nWhile this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian, and in turn could compromise the security of the Korean peninsula. Who is to say what these Chinese will do next?"

Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the Mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity.\n\nFortunately, our control over Fengtian via Mantetsu is extensive, and we can almost certainly force their government to reverse its decision. This may force the more patriotic and militaristic elements of the government to independently declare war, and the consequences of such a situation should also be considered."

Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison.\n\nThe Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions.

japfor.225.t:0 "United states in disarray"
japfor.225.d:0 "The civil war has erupted in the United states, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. This presents us with a chance to remove the American presence from the central Pacific by occupying the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
japfor.225.a:0 "Seize Guam!"
japfor.225.b:0 "Rather not."

japfor.226.t:0 "Japan Seizes Guam"
japfor.226.d:0 "With America in turmoil, Japan has moved onto the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Japan at this point."
japfor.226.a:0 "Too bad."

japfor.227.t:0 "Japan Seizes Motor Companies"
japfor.227.d:0 "With the nation in turmoil, Japan has seized control of several American motor companies operating there. The civil war has caused many of the companies to lose contact with their parent companies and they have been struggling to get parts for their assembly lines. This is made it rather easy for the Japanese to seize control of them under the pretence of 'assistance'. While this is clearly an illegal act, we are in no position to do anything more than send a strongly worded letter to them."
japfor.227.a:0 "Strongly worded indeed!"
