### Events ###
alash.1.t:0 "Independence for Alash autonomy?"
alash.1.d:0 "Our country, despite nominally being part of Russia with autonomous status has been de facto independent from the signing of the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite a Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia while repelling an invasion from Turkestan, our status remained unchanged thanks to Admiral Kolchak's coup d'état attempt. Now with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia!"
alash.1.a:0 "No, we must remain loyal to Russia"
alash.1.b:0 "Declare full independence from Russia"

alash.2.t:0 "Alash autonomous region declares independence!"
alash.2.d:0 "Terrible news! Our autonomous region of Alash-Orda has decided to use the political chaos in Russia following the assassination of Kerensky to sever almost all ties with Russia and declare independence. While many hotheads in the General Staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this treachery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be. For now..."

alash.3.t:0 "The Peoples of Alash Orda"

alash.8.t:0 "Russia is stirring up separatism!"
alash.8.d:0 "The resurgent Russian state is encouraging our ethnic Russian community to secede from our country and be incorporated into a greater Russia. What shall we do?"

alash.8.b:0 "Let them go, back maintain our interests in the area"

alash.11.c:0 "We must decline - Central Asia is a wasteland we have no need of"

alash.12.t:0 "The Alash Orda's Resolve"
alash.12.d:0 "Despite being dominated by ethnic Russians, Alash Orda has proclaimed that they owe nothing to the Russian Empire, and the new Tsar. How should we respond?"

alash.12.b:0 "Send gifts to show the Tsar's generosity."

alash.13.t:0 "Russia Resurgent"

alash.18.a:0 "God Save The Tsar! A Triumph of Propaganda!"

alash.19.t:0 "Help from Russia?"

alash.22.t:0 "The Submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.22.d:0 "The Kazakhs are in danger of being eliminated by the forces of Turkestan. They have come to the conclusion that only by being incorporated into Russia will they be able to live in peace and freedom. If we accept them, we will be fighting Turkestan ourselves..."
alash.22.a:0 "We shall welcome the Kazakhs and defend their rights"
alash.22.b:0 "We cannot risk such entanglements"

alash.23.t:0 "War in Central Asia"
alash.23.d:0 "The recent outbreak of hostilities in Central Asia is worrying to say the least, and brings great destabilisation to our frontiers. The Kazakhs have recently proclaimed that they shall fight on their own against Turkestan, but it seems that they are too weak to survive for very long.

alash.25.d:0 "After the armies of the Alash Orda claimed victory in Central Asia, Ismail Enver held a very emotional and moving speech in Samarkand in which he stated his relief over the ending of the 'Kardesh Harbi', or the Brother War.
