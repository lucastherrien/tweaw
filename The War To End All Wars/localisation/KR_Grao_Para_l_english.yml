AMA_the_great_riverland_desc:0 "The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the focal point of our new nation - indeed, Belém, our greatest city lies next to its great mouth. Upstream, however, there has always been a lack of political control. We must succeed where Brazil had failed and properly govern the riverland."

AMA_tracking_and_exploration_desc:0 "The Amazon is dense and forboding, with much of its verdant catacombs unexplored. We should recruit men with experiencing navagating the jungle and pass their knowledge to our armed forces and civilian administration."

AMA_prime_directive_desc:0 "While contact with civilization may bring some benefit to the most isolated native groups, it also would surely bring a myriad of problems, especially disease and culture destruction. We must institutionalize a pro-active yet socially conscious contact policy."
